    # TETRAHEDRON_NUM returns the N-th tetrahedron number.
    #
    #  Discussion:
    #
    #    The N-th tetrahedral number T3(N) is formed by the sum of the first
    #    N triangular numbers:
    #
    #      T3(N) = sum ( 1 <= I <= N ) T2(I)
    #            = sum ( 1 <= I <= N ) sum ( 1 <= J < I ) J
    #
    #    By convention, T3(0) = 0.
    #
    #    T3(N) = ( N * ( N + 1 ) * ( N + 2 ) ) / 6
    #
    #  First Values:
    #
    #     0
    #     1
    #     4
    #    10
