#
## I4_PARTITION_DISTINCT_COUNT returns any value of Q(N).
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    A partition of an integer N is a representation of the integer
#    as the sum of nonzero positive integers.  The order of the summands
#    does not matter.  The number of partitions of N is symbolized
#    by P(N).  Thus, the number 5 has P(N) = 7, because it has the 
#    following partitions:
#
#    5 = 5
#      = 4 + 1 
#      = 3 + 2 
#      = 3 + 1 + 1 
#      = 2 + 2 + 1 
#      = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 
#      = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
#
#    However, if we require that each member of the partition
#    be distinct, we are computing something symbolized by Q(N).
#    The number 5 has Q(N) = 3, because it has the following partitions 
#    into distinct parts:
#
#    5 = 5
#      = 4 + 1 
#      = 3 + 2
