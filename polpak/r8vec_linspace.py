#
## R8VEC_LINSPACE creates a column vector of linearly spaced values.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    An R8VEC is a vector of R8's.
#
#    While MATLAB has the built in command 
#
#      x = linspace ( a, b, n )
#
#    that command has the distinct disadvantage of returning a ROW vector.
#
#    4 points evenly spaced between 0 and 12 will yield 0, 4, 8, 12.
#
#    In other words, the interval is divided into N-1 even subintervals,
#    and the endpoints of intervals are used as the points.

#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer N, the number of entries in the vector.

#    Input, real A, B, the first and last entries.

#    Output, real X(N), a vector of linearly spaced data.
