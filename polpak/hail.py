#
## HAIL computes the hail function.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    Starting with a positive integer N, we divide it by 2 if it is
#    even, or triple and add 1 if odd, and repeat this process until
#    reaching the value 1.  The number of times the process is carried
#    out is the value of the hail function for the given starting value.
#
#    Actually, HAIL is not well defined, since it is not known if
#    the above process actually terminates at 1 for every starting value N.
#
#  Example:
#
#     N  Sequence                                                  Hail

#     2   1                                                           1
