## POLY_COEF_COUNT: polynomial coefficient count given dimension and degree.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    To count all monomials of degree 5 or less in dimension 3,
#    we can count all monomials of degree 5 in dimension 4.
#
#    To count all monomials of degree 5 in dimension 4, we imagine
#    that each of the variables X, Y, Z and W is a "box" and that
#    we need to drop 5 pebbles into these boxes.  Every distinct
#    way of doing this represents a degree 5 monomial in dimension 4.
#    Ignoring W gives us monomials up to degree five in dimension 3.
#
#    To count them, we draw 3 lines as separators to indicate the
#    4 boxes, and then imagine all disctinct sequences involving
#    the three lines and the 5 pebbles.  Indicate the lines by 1's
#    and the pebbles by 0's and we're asking for the number of
#    permutations of 3 1's and 5 0's, which is 8! / (3! 5!)
#
#    In other words, 56 = 8! / (3! 5!) is:
#    * the number of monomials of degree exactly 5 in dimension 4,
#    * the number of monomials of degree 5 or less in dimension 3,
#    * the number of polynomial coefficients of a polynomial of
#      degree 5 in (X,Y,Z).
#
#    In general, the formula for the number of monomials of degree DEG
#    or less in dimension DIM is
#
#      (DEG+DIM)! / (DEG! * DIM!)
