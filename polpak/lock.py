#
## LOCK returns the number of codes for a lock with N buttons.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    A button lock has N numbered buttons.  To open the lock, groups
#    of buttons must be pressed in the correct order.  Each button
#    may be pushed no more than once.  Thus, a code for the lock is
#    an ordered list of the groups of buttons to be pushed.
#
#    For this discussion, we will assume that EVERY button is pushed
#    at some time, as part of the code.  To count the total number
#    of codes, including those which don't use all the buttons, then
#    the number is 2 * A(N), or 2 * A(N) - 1 if we don't consider the
#    empty code to be valid.
#
#  Examples:
#
#    If there are 3 buttons, then there are 13 possible "full button" codes:
#
#      (123)
#      (12) (3)
#      (13) (2)
#      (23) (1)
#      (1) (23)
#      (2) (13)
#      (3) (12)
#      (1) (2) (3)
#      (1) (3) (2)
#      (2) (1) (3)
#      (2) (3) (1)
#      (3) (1) (2)
#      (3) (2) (1)
#
#    and, if we don't need to push all the buttons, every "full button" code above
#    yields a distinct "partial button" code by dropping the last set of buttons:
#
#      ()
#      (12)
#      (13)
#      (23)
#      (1)
#      (2)
#      (3)
#      (1) (2)
#      (1) (3)
#      (2) (1)
#      (2) (3)
#      (3) (1)
#      (3) (2)
#
#  First values:
#
#     N         A(N)
#     0           1
#     1           1
#     2           3
#     3          13
#     4          75
#     5         541
#     6        4683
#     7       47293
#     8      545835
#     9     7087261
#    10   102247563
#
#  Recursion:
#
#    A(I) = sum ( 0 <= J < I ) Binomial ( I, N-J ) * A(J)
