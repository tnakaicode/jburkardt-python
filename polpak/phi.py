## PHI computes the number of relatively prime predecessors of an integer.
#
#  Definition:
#
#    PHI(N) is the number of integers between 1 and N which are
#    relatively prime to N.  I and J are relatively prime if they
#    have no common factors.  The function PHI(N) is known as
#    "Euler's totient function".
#
#    By convention, 1 and N are relatively prime.
#
#  First values:
#
#     N  PHI(N)
#
#     1    1
#     2    1
#     3    2
#     4    2
#     5    4
#     6    2
#     7    6
#     8    4
#     9    6
#    10    4
#    11   10
#    12    4
#    13   12
#    14    6
#    15    8
#    16    8
#    17   16
#    18    6
#    19   18
#    20    8
#
#  Formula:
#
#    PHI(U*V) = PHI(U) * PHI(V) if U and V are relatively prime.
#
#    PHI(P^K) = P^(K-1) * ( P - 1 ) if P is prime.
#
#    PHI(N) = N * Product ( P divides N ) ( 1 - 1 / P )
#
#    N = Sum ( D divides N ) PHI(D).

#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer N, the value to be analyzed.
#
#    Output, integer VALUE, the value of PHI(N).  If N is less than
#    or equal to 0, PHI will be returned as 0.  If there is not enough
#    room for full factoring of N, PHI will be returned as -1.
