#
## LEGENDRE_SYMBOL evaluates the Legendre symbol (Q/P).
#
#  Definition:
#
#    Let P be an odd prime.  Q is a QUADRATIC RESIDUE modulo P
#    if there is an integer R such that R^2 = Q ( mod P ).
#    The Legendre symbol ( Q / P ) is defined to be:
#
#      + 1 if Q ( mod P ) /= 0 and Q is a quadratic residue modulo P,
#      - 1 if Q ( mod P ) /= 0 and Q is not a quadratic residue modulo P,
#        0 if Q ( mod P ) == 0.
#
#    We can also define ( Q / P ) for P = 2 by:
#
#      + 1 if Q ( mod P ) /= 0
#        0 if Q ( mod P ) == 0
#
#  Example:
#
#    (0/7) =   0
#    (1/7) = + 1  ( 1^2 = 1 mod 7 )
#    (2/7) = + 1  ( 3^2 = 2 mod 7 )
#    (3/7) = - 1
#    (4/7) = + 1  ( 2^2 = 4 mod 7 )
#    (5/7) = - 1
#    (6/7) = - 1
#
#  Note:
#
#    For any prime P, exactly half of the integers from 1 to P-1
#    are quadratic residues.
#
#    ( 0 / P ) = 0.
#
#    ( Q / P ) = ( mod ( Q, P ) / P ).
#
#    ( Q / P ) = ( Q1 / P ) * ( Q2 / P ) if Q = Q1 * Q2.
#
#    If Q is prime, and P is prime and greater than 2, then:
#
#      if ( Q == 1 ) then
#
#        ( Q / P ) = 1
#
#      else if ( Q == 2 ) then
#
#        ( Q / P ) = + 1 if mod ( P, 8 ) = 1 or mod ( P, 8 ) = 7,
#        ( Q / P ) = - 1 if mod ( P, 8 ) = 3 or mod ( P, 8 ) = 5.
#
#      else
#
#        ( Q / P ) = - ( P / Q ) if Q = 3 ( mod 4 ) and P = 3 ( mod 4 ),
#                  =   ( P / Q ) otherwise.
