def r8_atan2 ( y, x ):

#*****************************************************************************80
#
## R8_ATAN2 computes the inverse tangent of the ratio Y / X.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    R8_ATAN2 returns an angle whose tangent is ( Y / X ), a job which
#    the built in functions ATAN and ATAN2 already do.
#
#    However:
#
#    * R8_ATAN2 always returns a positive angle, between 0 and 2 PI,
#      while ATAN and ATAN2 return angles in the interval [-PI/2,+PI/2]
#      and [-PI,+PI] respectively;
#
#    * R8_ATAN2 accounts for the signs of X and Y, (as does ATAN2).  The ATAN
#     function by contrast always returns an angle in the first or fourth
#     quadrants.

#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, real Y, X, two quantities which represent the tangent of
#    an angle.  If Y is not zero, then the tangent is (Y/X).
#
#    Output, real VALUE, an angle between 0 and 2 * PI, whose tangent is
#    (Y/X), and which lies in the appropriate quadrant so that the signs
#    of its cosine and sine match those of X and Y.
