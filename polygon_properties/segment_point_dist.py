## SEGMENT_POINT_DIST: distance ( line segment, point ).
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    A line segment is the finite portion of a line that lies between
#    two points.
#
#    The nearest point will satisfy the condition
#
#      PN = (1-T) * P1 + T * P2.
#
#    T will always be between 0 and 1.

#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, real P1(2), P2(2), the endpoints of the line segment.
#
#    Input, real P(2), the point whose nearest neighbor on the line
#    segment is to be determined.
#
#    Output, real DIST, the distance from the point to the line segment.

#  If the line segment is actually a point, then the answer is easy.
