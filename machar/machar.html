      MACHAR <br> Dynamic Computation of Machine Constants
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MACHAR</b>,
      a Python library which
      dynamically computes constants that 
      characterize the floating point arithmetic system on a computer,
      by William Cody.
    </p>

    <p>
      The constants include
      the value of the "machine epsilon", the smallest number that can
      be added to 1 and make a difference.  However, it includes many
      other quantities of interest, including the arithmetic base,
      the largest and smallest magnitudes, and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      The default variable type in MATLAB is similar to a double precision
      complex variable.  When doing real arithmetic, this means that
      calculations are done in double precision.  MATLAB also offers
      a function called <b>single</b> that can be used to convert a
      value to a single precision real value.  When used to initialize
      a variable, <b>single</b> effectively "declares" that variable to
      be a single precision real variable.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Many compilers now do certain kinds of optimization that may cause
      MACHAR to fail.  The most noticeable symptom is that MACHAR may
      fall into an infinite loop.  If you notice this, recompile MACHAR
      with compiler optimization turned off, or set to the lowest level.
      (This s-*ould not be a problem when using Python.)

      The FORTRAN77 version of these routines was supplied as part of ACM 
      TOMS algorithm 665.

    <p>
      A C version of these routines was supplied as part of ACM 
      TOMS algorithm 722.

      Note that "Numerical Recipes" includes a listing and discussion
      of MACHAR.
