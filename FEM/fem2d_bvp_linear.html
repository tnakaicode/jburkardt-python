    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM2D_BVP_LINEAR</b>,
      a Python program which
      applies the finite element method, with piecewise bilinear elements,
      to a 2D boundary value problem over a rectangle.
    </p>

    <p>
      The boundary value problem (BVP) that is to be solved has the form:
      <pre>
        - d/dx ( a(x,y) * du/dx ) - d/dy ( a(x,y) * du/dy ) + c(x,y) * u(x,y) = f(x,y)
      </pre>
      This equation holds in the interior of some rectangle R.
      The functions a(x,y), c(x,y), and f(x,y) are given.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zero boundary conditions are imposed on the boundary of R.
    </p>

    <p>
      To compute a finite element approximation, the X and Y extents of R
      are gridded with NX and NY equally spaced values, respectively.
      This defines NX*NY nodes, and divides R into (NX-1)*(NY-1) rectangular
      elements.  At the K-th node, (X(I),Y(J)), a piecewise bilinear basis
      function PHI(K)(X,Y) is defined.  The solution will be represented as
      a linear combination of these basis functions.  An integral form 
      of the BVP is written, in which the differential equation is 
      multiplied by each basis function, and integration by parts is
      used to simplify the integrand.
