    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM1D_BVP_LINEAR</b>,
      a Python program which
      applies the finite element method, with piecewise linear elements,
      to a two point boundary value problem in one spatial dimension,
      and compares the computed and exact solutions 
      with the L2 and seminorm errors.
    </p>

    <p>
      The boundary value problem (BVP) that is to be solved has the form:
      <pre>
        - d/dx ( a(x) * du/dx ) + c(x) * u(x) = f(x)
      </pre>
      in the interval 0 &lt; x &lt; 1.  The functions a(x), c(x), and f(x) are
      given.
    </p>

    <p>
      Boundary conditions are applied at the endpoints, and in this case,
      these are assumed to have the form:
      <pre>
        u(0.0) = 0.0;
        u(1.0) = 0.0.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      To compute a finite element approximation, a set of n equally spaced
      nodes is defined from 0.0 to 1.0, a set of piecewise linear basis functions
      is set up, with one basis function associated with each node,
      and then an integral form of the BVP is used, in which the differential
      equation is multiplied by each basis function, and integration by parts is
      used to simplify the integrand.
    </p>

    <p>
      A simple two point Gauss quadrature formula is used to estimate the
      resulting integrals over each interval.
