def i4_gcd ( i, j ):

#*****************************************************************************80
#
## I4_GCD finds the greatest common divisor of I and J.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    Only the absolute values of I and J are
#    considered, so that the result is always nonnegative.
#
#    If I or J is 0, I4_GCD is returned as max ( 1, abs ( I ), abs ( J ) ).
#
#    If I and J have no common factor, I4_GCD is returned as 1.
#
#    Otherwise, using the Euclidean algorithm, I4_GCD is the
#    largest common factor of I and J.

#  Set IP to the larger of I and J, IQ to the smaller.
#  This way, we can alter IP and IQ as we go.
