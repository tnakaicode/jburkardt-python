      CHANGE_MAKING <br> Choosing Coins To Match a Given Value
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CHANGE_MAKING</b>,
      a Python library which
      considers the change making problem,
      in which a given sum is to be formed using coins of various denominations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The change making problem is given a target value C and a set of N coin
      denominations with value W.  The task is to determine the minimum number
      of coins needed to form the given value.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the unbounded change making problem, there are a limitless supply of
      coins of each denomination.  In the bounded change making problem, each
      denomination is available only up to some given limit.
    </p>

    <p>
      For some sets of denominations, there will be target values that cannot 
      be formed.  (This relates to Frobenius's problem.)  
    </p>

    <p>
      A greedy algorithm for solving the change making problem repeatedly selects
      the largest coin denomination available that does not exceed the remainder.
      A greedy algorithm is simple, but it is not guaranteed to find a solution
      when one exists, and it is not guaranteed to find a minimal solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      For certain sets of coin denominations, such as the US system of 1, 5, 10,
      25, 50, 100, there is always a solution, and the greedy algorithm will always
      find the minimal solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a set of coins such as the old British system, using 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48
      and 60, there is always a solution, but the greedy algorithm will not always
      find the minimal solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      For artificial systems such as 20, 25, 40, it is easy to see that there are many
      cases where there is no solution (you can't make ANY value that isn't a multiple
      of 5) but that the greedy will fail to find a solution for 50, even though that
      is easily formed as 25 + 25.
