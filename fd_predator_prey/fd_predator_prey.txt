FD_PREDATOR_PREY_TEST:
  Python version: 3.6.9

  Initial number of prey is 5000
  Initial number of predators is 100
  Time span is [0,5]
  Number of time steps will be 1000

FD_PREDATOR_PREY

  A finite difference approximate solution of a pair
  of ordinary differential equations for a population
  of predators and prey.

  The exact solution shows wave behavior, with a fixed
  period and amplitude.  The finite difference approximation
  can provide a good estimate for this behavior if the stepsize
  DT is small enough.
