    <p>
      <b>chuckaluck_simulation</b>,
      a Python program which
      simulates the Chuck-a-Luck gambling game.
    </p>

    <p>
      The player specifies a spot, between 1 and 6, and places a bet B.  
      Three dice are rolled, and the player's return is:
<pre>
   -  B if no spots show
   +  B for 1 spot
   +2 B for 2 spots
  +10 B for 3 spots
</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program allows the user to simulate many repeated rounds of the game,
      so that a statistical analysis can be made.
