    <p>
      <b>quadprog_test</b>,
      a Python program which
      calls quadprog() to 
      solve problems in quadratic programming.
    </p>

    <p>
      quadprog() is a Python function for solving quadratic
      programming problems of the form:
      <pre>
        minimize    1/2 x' H x - f' x
        subject to: A' x >= b     (inequality constraints)
      </pre>
      where H is a positive definite symmetric matrix, and the constraints
      are optional.  The most common problems involve the addition of some
      inequality constraints, which makes this problem similar to typical
      linear programming problems.  It is possible to add equality constraints
      if you can find the documentation.
    </p>

    <p>
      In what might seem an attempt to drive users mad, the sign conventions
      for quadprog() are at odds with those of the corresponding MATLAB code.
      In particular, we <b>subtract</b> f' x, we multiply by A', and the
      inequality sign is <b>greater than</b> rather than less than.  Of course,
      with only a minor loss of composure, it is possible to formulate the
      same problem with either the MATLAB or Python programs.
