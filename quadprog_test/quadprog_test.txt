quadprog_test
  Python version: 3.6.9
  Test quadprog()
  which solves quadratic programming problems.

  minimize    1/2 x H x - f x
  subject to: A x >= b

  H should be positive definite symmetric.

quadprog_test01
  minimize    1/2 x1^2 + x2^2 - x1x2 - 2x1 - 6x2
  subject to:  x1 +  x2 <= 2
              -x1 + 2x2 <= 2
              2x1 +  x2 <= 3

  Solution vector x = [ 0.666667, 1.33333 ]:
  Function value at x is -8.22222

quadprog_test02
  minimize    65/2 x^2 - 22xy + 7y^2 - 16xz + 7yz + 5/2z^2
              - 13x + 15y + 7z
  subject to:  x + 2y + z <=  3
              2x      + z <=  2
              -x + 2y - z <= -2

  Solution vector x = [ -0.490257, -1.57755, -0.664848 ]:
  Function value at x is -10.4949

quadprog_test
  Normal end of execution.
