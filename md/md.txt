MD_TEST
  Python version: 3.6.9
  Test the MD molecular dynamics program.

MD
  Python version: 3.6.9
  A molecular dynamics program.

  D_NUM, the spatial dimension, is 3
  P_NUM, the number of particles in the simulation is 500.
  STEP_NUM, the number of time steps, is 500.
  DT, the time step size, is 0.1 seconds.

  At each step, we report the potential and kinetic energies.
  The sum of these energies should be a constant.
  As an accuracy check, we also print the relative error
  in the total energy.
