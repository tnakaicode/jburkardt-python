#*****************************************************************************80
#
## THUE_BINARY_NEXT returns the next element in a binary Thue sequence.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    Thue demonstrated that arbitrarily long sequences of 0's and
#    1's could be generated which had the "cubefree" property.  In
#    other words, for a given string S, there was no substring W
#    such that S contained "WWW".  In fact, a stronger result holds:
#    if "a" is the first letter of W, it is never the case that S
#    contains the substring "WWa".
#
#    In this example, the digits allowed are binary, that is, just
#    "0" and "1".  The replacement rules are:
#
#    "0" -> "01"
#    "1" -> "10"
#
#    This routine produces the next binary Thue sequence in a given series.
#    However, the input sequence must be a Thue sequence in order for
#    us to guarantee that the output sequence will also have the
#    cubic nonrepetition property.
#
#    Also, enough space must be set aside in THUE to hold the
#    output sequence.  This will always be twice the input
#    value of N.

#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer N, the length of the input sequence.
#
#    Input, integer THUE(N), the initial Thue sequence.
#
#    Output, integer N, the length of the output sequence.
#
#    Output, integer THUE(N), the result of applying the substitution rules once.
