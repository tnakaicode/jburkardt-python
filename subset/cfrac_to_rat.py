#
## CFRAC_TO_RAT converts a monic continued fraction to an ordinary fraction.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    The routine is given the monic or "simple" continued fraction with
#    integer coefficients:
#
#      A(1) + 1 / ( A(2) + 1 / ( A(3) ... + 1 / A(N) ) )
#
#    and returns the N successive approximants P(I)/Q(I)
#    to the value of the rational number represented by the continued
#    fraction, with the value exactly equal to the final ratio P(N)/Q(N).

#    Output, integer P(N), Q(N), the N successive approximations
#    to the value of the continued fraction.
