## INDEX_BOX_NEXT_2D produces index vectors on the surface of a box in 2D.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    The index vectors are exactly those which are between (1,1) and
#    (N1,N2) with the property that at least one of I and J
#    is an "extreme" value.

#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer N1, N2, the "dimensions" of the box, that is, the
#    maximum values allowed for I and J.  The minimum values are
#    assumed to be 1.
#
#    Input, integer I, J, the previous index set.  The values of I and J
#    are not needed on the first call, with MORE set to FALSE.
#
#    Input, logical MORE, is FALSE on the first call, and TRUE therafter.
#
#    Output, integer I, J, the next index set.
#
#    Output, logical MORE, is TRUE if the routine can be called again
#    for more index sets.
