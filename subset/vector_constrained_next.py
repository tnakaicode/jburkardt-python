    # *****************************************************************************80
    #
    # VECTOR_CONSTRAINED_NEXT returns the "next" constrained vector.
    #
    #  Discussion:
    #
    #    We consider all vectors of dimension N whose components
    #    satisfy X_MIN(1:N) <= X(1:N) <= X_MAX(1:N).
    #
    #    We are only interested in the subset of these vectors which
    #    satisfy the following constraint:
    #
    #      sum ( 1 <= I <= N ) ( ( X(I) - 1 ) / X_MAX(I) ) <= 1
    #
    #    We can carry out this check using integer arithmetic if we
    #    multiply through by P = product ( X_MAX(1:N) ):
    #
    #      sum ( 1 <= I <= N ) ( ( X(I) - 1 ) * ( P / X_MAX(I) ) ) <= P.
    #
    #    This routine returns, one at a time, and in right-to-left
    #    lexicographic order, exactly those vectors which satisfy
    #    the constraint.
    #
    #  Example:
    #
    #    N = 3
    #    X_MIN:   2   2   1
    #    X_MAX:   4   5   3
    #
    #    P = 60
    #
    #    #  X(1)  X(2)  X(3)  CONSTRAINT
    #
    #    1    2     2     1       27
    #    2    3     2     1       42
    #    3    4     2     1       57
    #    4    2     3     1       39
    #    5    3     3     1       54
    #    6    2     4     1       51
    #    7    2     2     2       47
    #    8    2     3     2       59

    #
    #  Parameters:
    #
    #    Input, integer N, the number of components in the vector.
    #
    #    Input, integer X_MIN(N), X_MAX(N), the minimum and maximum
    #    values allowed in each component.
    #
    #    Input, integer X(N).  On first call (with MORE = FALSE),
    #    the input value of X is not important.  On subsequent calls, the
    #    input value of X should be the output value from the previous call.
    #    On output, (with MORE = TRUE), the value of X will be the "next"
    #    vector in the reverse lexicographical list of vectors that satisfy
    #    the condition.  However, on output with MORE = FALSE, the vector
    #    X is meaningless, because there are no more vectors in the list.
    #
    #    Input, logical MORE.  On input, if the user has set MORE
    #    FALSE, the user is requesting the initiation of a new sequence
    #    of values.  If MORE is TRUE, then the user is requesting "more"
    #    values in the current sequence.  On output, if MORE is TRUE,
    #    then another value was found and returned in X, but if MORE is
    #    FALSE, then there are no more values in the sequence, and X is
    #    NOT the next value.
    #
    #    Output, integer X(N).  On first call (with MORE = FALSE),
    #    the input value of X is not important.  On subsequent calls, the
    #    input value of X should be the output value from the previous call.
    #    On output, (with MORE = TRUE), the value of X will be the "next"
    #    vector in the reverse lexicographical list of vectors that satisfy
    #    the condition.  However, on output with MORE = FALSE, the vector
    #    X is meaningless, because there are no more vectors in the list.
    #
    #    Output, integer CONSTRAINT, the constraint value for X.  Valid vectors X
    #    will have a CONSTRAINT value between product(X_MIN(1:N)) (automatically)
    #    and product(X_MAX(1:N)) (because we skip over vectors with a
    #    constraint larger than this value).
    #
    #    Output, logical MORE.  On input, if the user has set MORE
    #    FALSE, the user is requesting the initiation of a new sequence
    #    of values.  If MORE is TRUE, then the user is requesting "more"
    #    values in the current sequence.  On output, if MORE is TRUE,
    #    then another value was found and returned in X, but if MORE is
    #    FALSE, then there are no more values in the sequence, and X is
    #    NOT the next value.
