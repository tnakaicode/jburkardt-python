#*****************************************************************************80
#
## KSUB_TO_COMP converts a K-subset to a composition.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    There is a bijection between K subsets and compositions.
#
#    Because we allow a composition to have entries that are 0, we need
#    to implicitly add 1 to each entry before establishing the bijection.
#
#    Let BS be a KS subset of a set of the integers 1 through NS.
#
#    Then let 
#      NC = NS - KS, 
#      KC = KS + 1, 
#    and define
#      AC(1) = BS(1) - 1;
#      AC(2:KC-1) = BS(2:KC-1) - BS(1:KC-2) - 1;
#      AC(KC) = NS - BS(KS).
#
#    Then AC is a composition of NC into KC parts.

#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer NS, the size of the set.
#
#    Input, integer KS, the size of the subset.
#
#    Input, integer BS(KS), the entries of the K-subset, in increasing order.
#
#    Output, integer NC, the composition sum.
#
#    Output, integer KC, the number of parts of the composition.
#
#    Output, integer AC(KC), the parts of the composition.
