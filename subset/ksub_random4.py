def ksub_random4 ( n, k, seed ):

#*****************************************************************************80
#
## KSUB_RANDOM4 selects a random subset of size K from a set of size N.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    This routine is somewhat impractical for the given problem, but
#    it is included for comparison, because it is an interesting
#    approach that is superior for certain applications.
#
#    The approach is mainly interesting because it is "incremental";
#    it proceeds by considering every element of the set, and does not
#    need to know how many elements there are.
#
#    This makes this approach ideal for certain cases, such as the
#    need to pick 5 lines at random from a text file of unknown length,
#    or to choose 6 people who call a certain telephone number on a
#    given day.  Using this technique, it is possible to make the
#    selection so that, whenever the input stops, a valid uniformly
#    random subset has been chosen.
#
#    Obviously, if the number of items is known in advance, and
#    it is easy to extract K items directly, there is no need for
#    this approach, and it is less efficient since, among other costs,
#    it has to generate a random number for each item, and make an
#    acceptance/rejection test.

#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer N, the size of the set from which subsets are drawn.
#
#    Input, integer K, number of elements in desired subsets.  K must
#    be between 0 and N.
#
#    Input, integer SEED, a seed for the random number generator.
#
#    Output, integer A(K), contains the indices of the selected items.
#
#    Output, integer SEED, a seed for the random number generator.

#  Here, we use a DO WHILE to suggest that the algorithm
#  proceeds to the next item, without knowing how many items
#  there are in total.
#
#  Note that this is really the only place where N occurs,
#  so other termination criteria could be used, and we really
#  don't need to know the value of N!
