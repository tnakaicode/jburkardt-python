#
## COMP_TO_KSUB converts a composition to a K-subset.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    There is a bijection between K subsets and compositions.
#
#    Because we allow a composition to have entries that are 0, we need
#    to implicitly add 1 to each entry before establishing the bijection.
#
#    Let AC be a composition of NC into KC parts.
#
#    Then let
#      NS = NC + KC - 1
#      KS = KC - 1
#    and define
#      AS(I) = sum ( AC(1:I) + 1 ), for I = 1 : KS.
#      
#    Then AS is a KS subset of the integers 1 through NS.

#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer NC, the composition sum.
