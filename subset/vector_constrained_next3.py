#
## VECTOR_CONSTRAINED_NEXT3 returns the "next" constrained vector.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    This routine addresses the same problem as VECTOR_CONSTRAINED_NEXT2,
#    and differs only in that real arithmetic is used, rather than
#    integer arithmetic.  Integer arithmetic allows us to do an exact
#    calculation, but we run into overflow problems in simple cases
#    where N is 10 and the X_MAX entries are of order 10, for instance.
#
#    We consider all vectors of dimension N whose components
#    satisfy X_MIN(1:N) <= X(1:N) <= X_MAX(1:N).
#
#    We are only interested in the subset of these vectors which
#    satisfy the following constraint:
#
#      sum ( 1 <= I <= N ) ( X(I) / X_MAX(I) ) <= 1
#
#  Example:
#
#    N = 3
#    X_MIN:   1   1   1
#    X_MAX:   5   6   4
#
#    P = 120
#
#    #  X(1)  X(2)  X(3)  CONSTRAINT
#
#    1    1     1     1      0.62
#    2    2     1     1      0.82
#    3    1     2     1      0.78
#    4    2     2     1      0.98
#    5    1     3     1      0.95
#    6    1     1     2      0.87

#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer N, the number of components in the vector.
#
#    Input, integer X_MIN(N), X_MAX(N), the minimum and maximum
#    values allowed in each component.
#
#    Input, integer X(N).  On first call (with MORE = FALSE),
#    the input value of X is not important.  On subsequent calls, the
#    input value of X should be the output value from the previous call.
#    On output, (with MORE = TRUE), the value of X will be the "next"
#    vector in the reverse lexicographical list of vectors that satisfy
#    the condition.  However, on output with MORE = FALSE, the vector
#    X is meaningless, because there are no more vectors in the list.
#
#    Input, logical MORE.  On input, if the user has set MORE
#    FALSE, the user is requesting the initiation of a new sequence
#    of values.  If MORE is TRUE, then the user is requesting "more"
#    values in the current sequence.  On output, if MORE is TRUE,
#    then another value was found and returned in X, but if MORE is
#    FALSE, then there are no more values in the sequence, and X is
#    NOT the next value.
#
#    Output, integer X(N).  On first call (with MORE = FALSE),
#    the input value of X is not important.  On subsequent calls, the
#    input value of X should be the output value from the previous call.
#    On output, (with MORE = TRUE), the value of X will be the "next"
#    vector in the reverse lexicographical list of vectors that satisfy
#    the condition.  However, on output with MORE = FALSE, the vector
#    X is meaningless, because there are no more vectors in the list.
#
#    Output, real CONSTRAINT, the constraint value for X.  
#    Valid vectors X will have a CONSTRAINT value between 
#      product(X_MIN(1:N)) / product(X_MAX(1:N))
#    and 1.0.
#
#    Output, logical MORE.  On input, if the user has set MORE
#    FALSE, the user is requesting the initiation of a new sequence
#    of values.  If MORE is TRUE, then the user is requesting "more"
#    values in the current sequence.  On output, if MORE is TRUE,
#    then another value was found and returned in X, but if MORE is
#    FALSE, then there are no more values in the sequence, and X is
#    NOT the next value.
