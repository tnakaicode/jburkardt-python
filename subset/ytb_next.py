def ytb_next ( n, lam, a, more ):

#*****************************************************************************80
#
## YTB_NEXT computes the next Young tableau for a given shape.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    When the routine is called with MORE = FALSE (the first time), and
#    if LAM on this call has M parts, with M < N, then the user
#    must also make sure that LAM(M+1) = 0.

#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer N, the integer which is to be partitioned.
#
#    Input, integer LAM(N), contains a partition of N.
#    The elements of LAM are nonnegative integers that sum to N.
#    On the first call, with MORE = FALSE, the user sets LAM.
#    After the first call, the input value of LAM is not important.
#
#    Input, integer A(N).  On the first call, with MORE = FALSE,
#    no value of A needs to be set.  After the first call, the input
#    value of A should be the output value of A from the previous call.
#
#    Input, logical MORE.  Set MORE to FALSE before the first call.
#    Thereafter, set it to the output value of MORE on the previous call.
#
#    Output, integer LAM(N), contains the partition of N,
#    corresponding to the Young tableau.
#
#    Output, integer A(N), the next Young tableau.  A(I) is the
#    row containing I in the output tableau.
#
#    Output, logical MORE, is TRUE until the last tableau is returned,
#    when the value of MORE is FALSE.
