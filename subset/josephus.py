#
## JOSEPHUS returns the position X of the K-th man to be executed.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    The classic Josephus problem concerns a circle of 41 men.
#    Every third man is killed and removed from the circle.  Counting
#    and executing continues until all are dead.  Where was the last
#    survivor sitting?
#
#    Note that the first person killed was sitting in the third position.
#    Moreover, when we get down to 2 people, and we need to count the
#    "third" one, we just do the obvious thing, which is to keep counting
#    around the circle until our count is completed.
#
#    The process may be regarded as generating a permutation of
#    the integers from 1 to N.  The permutation would be the execution
#    list, that is, the list of the executed men, by position number.

#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer N, the number of men.
#    N must be positive.
#
#    Input, integer M, the counting index.
#    M must not be zero.  Ordinarily, M is positive, and no greater than N.
#
#    Input, integer K, the index of the executed man of interest.
#    K must be between 1 and N.
#
#    Output, integer X, the position of the K-th man.
#    X will be between 1 and N.
