#
## MULTINOMIAL_COEF2 computes a multinomial coefficient.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    The multinomial coefficient is a generalization of the binomial
#    coefficient.  It may be interpreted as the number of combinations of
#    N objects, where FACTOR(1) objects are indistinguishable of type 1,
#    ... and FACTOR(NFACTOR) are indistinguishable of type NFACTOR,
#    and N is the sum of FACTOR(1) through FACTOR(NFACTOR).
#
#    NCOMB = N! / ( FACTOR(1)! FACTOR(2)! ... FACTOR(NFACTOR)! )
#
#    A direct method is used, which should be exact.  However, there
#    is a possibility of intermediate overflow of the result.

#    Input, integer FACTOR(NFACTOR), contains the factors.
