## I4POLY_DEGREE returns the degree of a polynomial.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    The degree of a polynomial is the index of the highest power
#    of X with a nonzero coefficient.
#
#    The degree of a constant polynomial is 0.  The degree of the
#    zero polynomial is debatable, but this routine returns the
#    degree as 0.
