#
## TUPLE_NEXT_GE computes the next "nondecreasing" element of a tuple space.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    The elements are N vectors.  Each element is constrained to lie
#    between 1 and M, and to have components that are nondecreasing.
#    That is, for an element X, and any positive K,
#      X(I) <= X(I+K)
#
#    The elements are produced one at a time.
#    The first element is
#      (1,1,...,1)
#    and the last element is
#      (M,M,...,M)
#    Intermediate elements are produced in lexicographic order.
#
#  Example:
#
#    N = 3, M = 3
#
#    RANK   X
#    ----  -----
#       1  1 1 1
#       2  1 1 2
#       3  1 1 3
#       4  1 2 2
#       5  1 2 3
#       6  1 3 3
#       7  2 2 2
#       8  2 2 3
#       9  2 3 3
#      10  3 3 3

#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer M, the maximum entry.
#
#    Input, integer N, the number of components.
#
#    Input, integer RANK, the rank of the input tuple.
#    On first call, set K to 0.  Thereafter, K will indicate the
#    order of the element returned.  When there are no more elements,
#    K will be returned as 0.
#
#    Input, integer X(N), on input the previous tuple (except
#    on the first call, when the input value of X is not needed.)
#    On output, the next tuple.
#
#    Output, integer RANK, the rank of the output tuple.
#    When there are no more elements, RANK will be returned as 0.
#
#    Output, integer X(N), on input the previous tuple (except
#    on the first call, when the input value of X is not needed.)
#    On output, the next tuple.
