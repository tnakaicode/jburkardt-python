#*****************************************************************************80
#
## TUPLE_NEXT computes the next element of a tuple space.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    The elements are N vectors.  Each entry is constrained to lie
#    between M1 and M2.  The elements are produced one at a time.
#    The first element is
#      (M1,M1,...,M1),
#    the second element is
#      (M1,M1,...,M1+1),
#    and the last element is
#      (M2,M2,...,M2)
#    Intermediate elements are produced in lexicographic order.
#
#  Example:
#
#    N = 2, M1 = 1, M2 = 3
#

#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer M1, M2, the minimum and maximum entries.
#
#    Input, integer N, the number of components.
#
#    Input, integer RANK, counts the elements.
#    On first call, set RANK to 0.  On subsequent calls, the input value of
#    RANK should be the output value of RANK from the previous call.
#
#    Input, integer X(N), the previous tuple.
#
#    Output, integer RANK, the order of the next tuple.  When there are no
#    more elements, RANK will be returned as 0.
#
#    Output, integer X(N), the next tuple.
