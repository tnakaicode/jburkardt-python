#
## THUE_TERNARY_NEXT returns the next element in a ternary Thue sequence.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    Thue was interested in showing that there were arbitrarily long
#    sequences of digits which never displayed a pair of contiguous
#    repetitions of any length.  That is, there was no occurrence of
#    "00" or "1010" or "121121", anywhere in the string.  This makes
#    the string "squarefree".
#
#    To do this, he demonstrated a way to start with a single digit,
#    and to repeatedly apply a series of transformation rules to each
#    digit of the sequence, deriving nonrepeating sequences of ever
#    greater length.
#
#    In this example, the digits allowed are ternary, that is, just
#    "0", "1" and "2".  The replacement rules are:
#
#    "0" -> "12"
#    "1" -> "102"
#    "2" -> "0"
#
#    This routine produces the next Thue sequence in a given series.
#    However, the input sequence must be a Thue sequence in order for
#    us to guarantee that the output sequence will also have the
#    nonrepetition property.
#
#    Also, enough space must be set aside in THUE to hold the
#    output sequence.  This will never be more than 3 times the input
#    value of N.
