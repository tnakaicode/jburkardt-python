#*****************************************************************************80
#
## RAT_TO_CFRAC converts a rational value to a continued fraction.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    The routine is given a rational number represented by P/Q, and
#    computes the monic or "simple" continued fraction representation
#    with integer coefficients of the number:
#
#      A(1) + 1/ (A(2) + 1/ (A(3) + ... + 1/A(N) ...))
#
#    The user must dimension A to a value M which is "large enough".
#    The actual number of terms needed in the continued fraction
#    representation cannot be known beforehand.

#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer P, Q, the numerator and denominator of the
#    rational value whose continued fraction representation is
#    desired.
#
#    Output, integer N, the number of entries in A.
#
#    Output, integer A(N), contains the continued fraction
#    representation of the number.
