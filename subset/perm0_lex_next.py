#*****************************************************************************80
#
## PERM0_LEX_NEXT generates permutations of (0,...,N-1) in lexical order.
#
#  Example:
#
#    N = 3
#
#    1   0 1 2
#    2   0 2 1
#    3   1 0 2
#    4   1 2 0
#    5   2 0 1
#    6   2 1 0

#    Algorithm 202: Generation of Permutations in Lexicographical Order,
#    Communications of the ACM,
#    Volume 6, September 1963, page 517.
#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer N, the number of elements being permuted.
#
#    Input, integer P(N), the permutation, in standard index form.
#
#    Input, logical MORE.
#    On the first call, the user should set MORE = FALSE, which signals
#    the routine to do initialization.
#    On return, if MORE is TRUE, then another permutation has been
#    computed and returned, while if MORE is FALSE, there are no more
#    permutations.
#
#    Output, integer P(N), the next permutation.
#
#    Output, logical MORE.
#    On the first call, the user should set MORE = FALSE, which signals
#    the routine to do initialization.
#    On return, if MORE is TRUE, then another permutation has been
#    computed and returned, while if MORE is FALSE, there are no more
#    permutations.
