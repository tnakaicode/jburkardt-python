#
## VEC_GRAY_NEXT computes the elements of a product space.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    The elements are produced one at a time.
#
#    This routine handles the case where the number of degrees of freedom may
#    differ from one component to the next.
#
#    A method similar to the Gray code is used, so that successive
#    elements returned by this routine differ by only a single element.
#
#    A previous version of this routine used internal static memory.
#
#  Example:
#
#    N = 2, BASE = ( 2, 3 ), DONE = TRUE
#
#     A    DONE  CHANGE
#    ---  -----  ------
#    0 0  FALSE    1
#    0 1  FALSE    2
#    0 2  FALSE    2
#    1 2  FALSE    1
#    1 1  FALSE    2
#    1 0  FALSE    2
#    1 0   TRUE   -1

#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer N, the number of components.
#
#    Input, integer BASE(N), contains the number of degrees of
#    freedom of each component.  The output values of A will
#    satisfy 0 <= A(I) < BASE(I).
#
#    Input/output, integer A(N).  On the first call, the input value
#    of A doesn't matter.  Thereafter, it should be the same as
#    its output value from the previous call. On output, A contains
#    the next vector. 
#
#    Input/output, logical DONE.  On the first call, the user must
#    set DONE to TRUE.  Thereafter, DONE should be set to the output
#    value of DONE on the previous call.  If the output value is FALSE,
#    then the program has computed another entry in A.  If the output
#    value of DONE is TRUE, then there are no more entries.
#
#    Input/output, integer ACTIVE(N), DIR(N), work arrays needed by the 
#    function.  The user should create them before the first call, but 
#    thereafter should not change their values, passing in the output values 
#    of the previous call for the next call.
#
#    Output, integer CHANGE, is set to the index of the element whose
#    value was changed.  On return from the first call, CHANGE
#    is 0, even though all the elements have been "changed".  On
#    return with DONE equal to TRUE, CHANGE is -1.
#

#
#  The user is calling for the first time.

#  vector, and deactivate the index.
