    #
    # FROBENIUS_NUMBER_ORDER2 returns the Frobenius number for order 2.
    #
    #  Discussion:
    #
    #    The Frobenius number of order N is the solution of the Frobenius
    #    coin sum problem for N coin denominations.
    #
    #    The Frobenius coin sum problem assumes the existence of
    #    N coin denominations, and asks for the largest value that cannot
    #    be formed by any combination of coins of these denominations.
    #
    #    The coin denominations are assumed to be distinct positive integers.
    #
    #    For general N, this problem is fairly difficult to handle.
    #
    #    For N = 2, it is known that:
    #
    #    * if C1 and C2 are not relatively prime, then
    #      there are infinitely large values that cannot be formed.
    #
    #    * otherwise, the largest value that cannot be formed is
    #      C1 * C2 - C1 - C2, and that exactly half the values between
    #      1 and C1 * C2 - C1 - C2 + 1 cannot be represented.
    #
    #    As a simple example, if C1 = 2 and C2 = 7, then the largest
    #    unrepresentable value is 5, and there are (5+1)/2 = 3
    #    unrepresentable values, namely 1, 3, and 5.
    #
    #    For a general N, and a set of coin denominations C1, C2, ..., CN,
    #    the Frobenius number F(N, C(1:N) ) is defined as the largest value
    #    B for which the equation
    #
    #      C1*X1 + C2*X2 + ... + CN*XN = B
    #
    #    has no nonnegative integer solution X(1:N).
    #
    #    In the Mathematica Package "NumberTheory", the Frobenius number
    #    can be determined by
    #
    #    <<NumberTheory`Frobenius`
    #    FrobeniusF[ {C1,...,CN} ]
