def change_greedy ( total, coin_num, coin_value ):

#*****************************************************************************80
#
## CHANGE_GREEDY makes change for a given total using the biggest coins first.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    The algorithm is simply to use as many of the largest coin first,
#    then the next largest, and so on.
#
#    It is assumed that there is always a coin of value 1.  The
#    algorithm will otherwise fail!
#
#  Example:
#
#    Total = 17
#    COIN_NUM = 3
#    COIN_VALUE = (/ 1, 5, 10 /)
#
#
#    #  CHANGE              COIN_VALUE(CHANGE)
#
#    4  3 2 1 1             10 5 1 1

#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer TOTAL, the total for which change is to be made.
#
#    Input, integer COIN_NUM, the number of types of coins.
#
#    Input, integer COIN_VALUE(COIN_NUM), the value of each coin.
#    The values should be in ascending order, and if they are not,
#    they will be sorted.
#
#    Output, integer CHANGE_NUM, the number of coins given in change.
#
#    Output, integer CHANGE(TOTAL), the indices of the coins will be
#    in entries 1 through CHANGE_NUM.
