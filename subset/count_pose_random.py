## COUNT_POSE_RANDOM poses a problem for the game "The Count is Good"
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    The French television show "The Count is Good" has a game that goes
#    as follows:
#
#      A number is chosen at random between 100 and 999.  This is the GOAL.
#
#      Six numbers are randomly chosen from the set 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
#      9, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100.  These numbers are the BLOCKS.
#
#      The player must construct a formula, using some or all of the blocks,
#      (but not more than once), and the operations of addition, subtraction,
#      multiplication and division.  Parentheses should be used to remove
#      all ambiguity.  However, it is forbidden to use subtraction in a
#      way that produces a negative result, and all division must come out
#      exactly, with no remainder.
#
#    This routine poses a sample problem from the show.  The point is,
#    to determine how to write a program that can solve such a problem.

#
#    Output, integer BLOCKS(6), the six numbers available for the formula.
#
#    Output, integer GOAL, the goal number.
#
#    Output, integer SEED, an updated seed for the random number generator.
