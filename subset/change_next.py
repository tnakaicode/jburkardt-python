#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer TOTAL, the total for which change is to be made.
#
#    Input, integer COIN_NUM, the number of types of coins.
#
#    Input, integer COIN_VALUE(COIN_NUM), the value of each coin.
#    The values should be in ascending order.
#
#    Input, integer CHANGE_NUM, the output value of CHANGE_NUM
#    from the previous call.  This value is not needed on a startup call.
#
#    Input, integer CHANGE(CHANGE_NUM), the output value of CHANGE
#    from the previous call.  This value is not needed on a startup call.
#
#    Input, logical DONE.  The user sets DONE = TRUE on the
#    first call to tell the routine this is the beginning of a computation.
#    Thereafter, DONE should be set to the output value of DONE from]
#    the previous call.
#
#    Output, integer CHANGE_NUM, the number of coins given in change
#    for the next set of change.
#
#    Output, integer CHANGE(CHANGE_NUM), the indices of the coins
#    used in this set of change.
#
#    Output, logical DONE, is FALSE until the last possible set of change
#    has been made.
