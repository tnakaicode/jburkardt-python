#
## COMP_ENUM returns the number of compositions of the integer N into K parts.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    A composition of the integer N into K parts is an ordered sequence
#    of K nonnegative integers which sum to N.  The compositions (1,2,1)
#    and (1,1,2) are considered to be distinct.
#
#    The 28 compositions of 6 into three parts are:
#
#      6 0 0,  5 1 0,  5 0 1,  4 2 0,  4 1 1,  4 0 2,
#      3 3 0,  3 2 1,  3 1 2,  3 0 3,  2 4 0,  2 3 1,
#      2 2 2,  2 1 3,  2 0 4,  1 5 0,  1 4 1,  1 3 2,
#      1 2 3,  1 1 4,  1 0 5,  0 6 0,  0 5 1,  0 4 2,
#      0 3 3,  0 2 4,  0 1 5,  0 0 6.
#
#    The formula for the number of compositions of N into K parts is
#
#      Number = ( N + K - 1 )! / ( N! * ( K - 1 )! )
#
#    Describe the composition using N '1's and K-1 dividing lines '|'.
#    The number of distinct permutations of these symbols is the number
#    of compositions.  This is equal to the number of permutations of
#    N+K-1 things, with N identical of one kind and K-1 identical of another.
#
#    Thus, for the above example, we have:
#
#      Number = ( 6 + 3 - 1 )! / ( 6! * (3-1)! ) = 28
