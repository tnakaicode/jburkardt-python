      C4LIB <br> A Single Precision Complex Arithmetic Utility Library
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>C4LIB</b>,
      a Python library which 
      implements certain
      elementary functions for "C4" or
      single precision complex variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      The symbol "C4" is used to suggest a single precision complex
      variable.  Here the 4 indicates that the underlying pair of
      real numbers each use 4 bytes of storage.
    </p>

    <p>
      C4LIB contains routines that operate on scalars, vectors or
      doubly dimensioned arrays of C4's.  A vector of C4's is denoted
      a C4VEC, and a doubly dimensioned array is a C4MAT.
