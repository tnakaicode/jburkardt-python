      BICYCLE_LOCK <br> The Bicycle Lock Problem
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>BICYCLE_LOCK</b>,
      a Python program which
      simulates the process of determining the combination of a bicycle lock.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program demonstrates the method of exhaustive search, that is,
      it searches for an answer by trying every possibility.  This requires
      a way of logically ordering the possibilities.
