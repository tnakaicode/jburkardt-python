#*****************************************************************************80
#
## orth_random returns an ORTH_RANDOM matrix.
#
#  Properties:
#
#    The inverse of A is equal to A'.
#
#    A is orthogonal: A * A'  = A' * A = I.
#
#    Because A is orthogonal, it is normal: A' * A = A * A'.
#
#    Columns and rows of A have unit Euclidean norm.
#
#    Distinct pairs of columns of A are orthogonal.
#
#    Distinct pairs of rows of A are orthogonal.
#
#    The L2 vector norm of A*x = the L2 vector norm of x for any vector x.
#
#    The L2 matrix norm of A*B = the L2 matrix norm of B for any matrix B.
#
#    det ( A ) = +1 or -1.
#
#    A is unimodular.
#
#    All the eigenvalues of A have modulus 1.
#
#    All singular values of A are 1.
#
#    All entries of A are between -1 and 1.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    Thanks to Eugene Petrov, B I Stepanov Institute of Physics,
#    National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, for convincingly
#    pointing out the severe deficiencies of an earlier version of
#    this routine.
#
#    Essentially, the computation involves saving the Q factor of the
#    QR factorization of a matrix whose entries are normally distributed.
#    However, it is only necessary to generate this matrix a column at
#    a time, since it can be shown that when it comes time to annihilate
#    the subdiagonal elements of column K, these (transformed) elements of
#    column K are still normally distributed random values.  Hence, there
#    is no need to generate them at the beginning of the process and
#    transform them K-1 times.
#
#    For computational efficiency, the individual Householder transformations
#    could be saved, as recommended in the reference, instead of being
#    accumulated into an explicit matrix format.

#  Now behave as though we were computing the QR factorization of

#  compute the Householder matrix H1 that annihilates the subdiagonal elements,

#
#  On the second step, generate the lower N-1 elements of the second column,
#  compute the Householder matrix H2 that annihilates them,
#  and set A := A * H2' = A * H2 = H1 * H2.
#
#  On the N-1 step, generate the lower 2 elements of column N-1,
#  compute the Householder matrix HN-1 that annihilates them, and
#  and set A := A * H(N-1)' = A * H(N-1) = H1 * H2 * ... * H(N-1).
#  This is our random orthogonal matrix.
