def helmert2 ( n, x ):

#*****************************************************************************80
#
## HELMERT2 returns the HELMERT2 matrix.
#
#  Formula:
#
#    Row 1 = the vector, divided by its L2 norm.
#
#    Row 2 is computed by the requirements that it be orthogonal to row 1,
#    be nonzero only from columns 1 to 2, and have a negative diagonal.
#
#    Row 3 is computed by the requirements that it be orthogonal to
#    rows 1 and 2, be nonzero only from columns 1 to 3, and have a
#    negative diagonal, and so on.
#
#  Properties:
#
#    The first row of A should be the vector X, divided by its L2 norm.
#
#    A is orthogonal: A' * A = A * A' = I.
#
#    A is not symmetric: A' ~= A.
