ELLIPSOID_GRID_COUNT_TEST:
  Python version: 3.6.9
  ELLIPSOID_GRID_COUNT can count the points in a grid,
  with N+1 points on the most minor half axis,
  based on any ellipsoid.

  We use N = 4
  Radius R = (2,1,1.5)
  Center C = (1,2,1.5)

  Number of grid points will be 1163

ELLIPSOID_GRID_POINTS_TEST:
  Python version: 3.6.9
  ELLIPSOID_GRID_POINTS can define a grid of points
  with N+1 points on the minor half axis,
  based on any ellipsoid.

  We use N = 4
  Radius R = (2,1,1.5)
  Center C = (1,2,1.5)

  Number of grid points will be 1163
