      <b>lorenz_sensitivity_test</b>,
      a Python program which
      demonstrates sensitivity to initial conditions in the Lorenz system,
      using an approach suggested by John D Cook.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Lorenz system, originally intended as a simplified model of
      atmospheric convection, has instead become a standard example of
      sensitive dependence on initial conditions; that is, tiny differences
      in the starting condition for the system rapidly become magnified.
      The system also exhibits what is known as the "Lorenz attractor",
      that is, the collection of trajectories for different starting points
      tends to approach a peculiar butterfly-shaped region.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Lorenz system includes three ordinary differential equations:
      <pre>
        dx/dt = sigma ( y - x )
        dy/dt = x ( rho - z ) - y
        dz/dt = xy - beta z
      </pre>
      where the parameters beta, rho and sigma are usually assumed to be
      positive.  The classic case uses the parameter values
      <pre>
        beta = 8 / 3
        rho = 28
        sigma - 10
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The initial conditions for this system are not often specified; rather,
      investigators simply note that the trajectories associated with two very
      close starting points will eventually separate.  In this program, 
      we consider two initial conditions at t=0:
      <pre>
        x1 = 1
        y1 = 1
        z1 = 1
      </pre>
      and
      <pre>
        x1 = 1
        y1 = 1
        z1 = 1.00001
      </pre>
      and allow the system to evolve over 0 &leq; t &leq; 40.  Plotting
      the values of x1-x2 over time shows the rather large and chaotic
      variation in the solutions.
