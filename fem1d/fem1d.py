#*****************************************************************************80
#
## FEM1D solves a 1D boundary value problem using finite elements.
#
#  Location:
#
#    http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/py_src/fem1d/fem1d.py
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    The PDE is defined for 0 < x < 1:
#      -u'' = f
#    with right hand side
#      f(x) = -(exact(x)'') 
#    and boundary conditions
#      u(0) = exact(0),
#      u(1) = exact(1).
#
#    The exact solution is:
#      exact(x) = x * ( 1 - x ) * exp ( x )
#    The boundary conditions are
#      u(0) = 0.0 = exact(0.0),
#      u(1) = 0.0 = exact(1.0).
#    The right hand side is:
#      f(x) = x * ( x + 3 ) * exp ( x ) = - ( exact''(x) )
