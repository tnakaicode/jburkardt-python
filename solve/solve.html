      SOLVE <br> Linear Solver for Double Dimensioned Arrays
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SOLVE</b>,
      a Python library which
      solves a linear system of equations A*x=b using Gauss elimination.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Python, there are a number of high quality functions, such as the
      numpy.linalg.solve() function, which could be used for this purpose.
      Nonetheless, this library may be useful because:
      <ul>
        <li>
          it shows the steps involved in a simple Gauss-elimination procedure;
        </li>
        <li>
          it can be used to count the number of operations in Gauss-elimination;
        </li>
        <li>
          it can be used as a guide for writing a corresponding program
          in a non-Python environment;
        </li>
        <li>
          its performance can be compared to corresponding versions in C, C++,
          Fortran and MATLAB;
        </li>
        <li>
          it can be used as a starting point for exploring band storage,
          sparse storage, iterative solutions and other topics in linear 
          algebra.
        </li>
      </ul>
