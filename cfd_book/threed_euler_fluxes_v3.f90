!********************************************************************************
!* A collection of three-dimensional Euler numerical fluxes, Version 3 (2012),
!*
!*        written by Dr. Katate Masatsuka (info[at]cfdbooks.com),
!*
!* the author of useful CFD books, "I do like CFD" (http://www.cfdbooks.com).
!*
!*------------------------
!* List of Flux Functions:
!*
!*   inviscid_roe          : Roe flux (using face normal and tangent vectors)
!*   inviscid_roe_n        : Roe flux (using face normal vector only)
!*   inviscid_rotated_rhll : Rotated-RHLL flux (one of the robust fluxes for carbuncle)
!*
!*------------------------
!*
!* These F90 routines were written and made available for an educational purpose.
!* Detailed descripstion of each numerical flux can be found in the original paper,
!* or in popular textbooks, or in the (will-be-available) second volume of
!* "I do like CFD".
!*
!* Note: These subroutines have been prepared for an educational purpose.
!*       It is not at all efficient. Think about how you can optimize it.
!*       One way to make it efficient is to reduce the number of local variables,
!*       by re-using temporary variables as many times as possible.
!*
!* Note: Please let me know if you find bugs. I'll greatly appreciate it and
!*       fix the bugs.
!*
!* Version 01
!* 05-06-11: Minor bugs fixed.
!*
!* Version 02
!* 04-06-12: Major bugs fixed for Rotated-RHLL flux.
!*           - qL and qR were not computed with the correct normals
!*           - Tangent vector (2nd direction) is now computed more carefully.
!*           (Bugs reported by Dr. Yoshitaka Nakashima. Thank you!)
!*
!* Version 03
!* 04-16-12: Equal sign has been added in the if-statement for tangent vector to
!*           avoid a possible failure (reported by Dr. Yoshitaka Nakashima. Thank you!)
!*           Roe flux without tangent vectors (inviscid_roe_n) added.
!*           Many more comments added.
!*
!* This file may be updated in future. (to add more flux functions.)

!* The Rotated-RHLL flux is defined as

!*                    Roe(n)                         ,  if |dq| < eps

!* where n1 is taken as the velocity difference vector (normal to shock or
!* tangent to shear waves), n2 is a vector perpendicular to n1,
!* alpha1 = n*n1, alpha2 = n*n2. That is, we decompose the normal vector, n,
!* in the two directions, n1 and n2, and apply the HLL in n1 and the Roe in n2.
!* However, the resulting flux can be simplified and can be made to look like
!* a single Roe-type flux. The additional cost over the Roe flux is reported
!* to be as small as 14% of the Roe flux.
!*
!* Note: HLL is introduced only near discontinuities and only by a fraction, alpha1.
!* Note: For full convergence to machine zero for staedy state computations,
!*       the vectors, n1 and n2, may have to be frozen. For time-accurate
