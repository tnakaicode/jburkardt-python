      <b>triangle_distance</b>,
      a Python library which 
      considers the problem of describing the typical value of the distance
      between a pair of points randomly selected in a triangle.
    </p>

    <p>
      This problem is notably more complicated than when the sampling region 
      is a square.  In particular, the probability density function for the 
      distance seems to be known only for special cases, such as a right 
      triangle or equilateral triangle.
