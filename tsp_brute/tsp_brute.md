# TSP Brute - a small traveling salesman problem

 The user must prepare a file beforehand, containing the city-to-city distances.
 The program will request the name of this file, and then read it in.

An example of such a file is:

```bash
0  3  4  2  7
3  0  4  6  3
4  4  0  5  8
2  6  5  0  6
7  3  8  6  0
```
