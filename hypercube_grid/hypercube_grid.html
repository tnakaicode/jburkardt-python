      HYPERCUBE_GRID <br> Grid of Points Inside a Hypercube in M Dimensions
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HYPERCUBE_GRID</b>,
      a Python library which
      generates a grid of points
      over the interior of a hypercube in M dimensions.
    </p>

    <p>
       The M-dimensional hypercube is the set of points (X(1),X(2),...,X(M)) 
       such that:
       <pre>
         A(I) <= X(I) <= B(I)
       </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For each dimension I, a set of parameters is input:
      <ul>
        <li>
          NS(I), the number of points along the I-th coordinate direction;
        </li>
        <li>
          A(I), B(I), the left and right endpoints of the I-th coordinate.
        </li>
        <li>
          C(I), one of 5 choices for centering the grid in the I-th coordinate.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
       The centering options allow the user to control the centering of the
       equally spaced points.  This is easiest to illustrate if we look at a
       1 dimensional case and assume A = 0 and B = 1.  Then, using NS = 4,
       the centering options will produce 4 equally spaced points as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>
          1: 0,   1/3, 2/3, 1  (include endpoints)
        </li>
        <li>
          2: 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5  (do not include endpoints)
        </li>
        <li>
          3: 0,   1/4, 2/4, 3/4  (do not include right endpoint)
        </li>
        <li>
          4: 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 1  (do not include left endpoint)
        </li>
        <li>
          5: 1/8, 3/8, 5/8, 7/8 (half spacing at the ends)
        </li>
      </ul>
