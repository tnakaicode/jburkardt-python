      LINE_GRID <br> Grid of Points Inside a Line Segment in 1D
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>LINE_GRID</b>,
      a Python library which
      generates a grid of points
      over the interior of a line segment in 1D.
    </p>

    <p>
       The 1D line segment is the set of points X
       such that:
       <pre>
         A <= X <= B
       </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      A set of parameters is specified:
      <ul>
        <li>
          N, the number of points;
        </li>
        <li>
          A, B, the left and right endpoints;
        </li>
        <li>
          C, one of 5 choices for centering the grid;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
       The centering options allow the user to control the centering of the
       equally spaced points.  Assume A = 0 and B = 1.  Then, using N = 4,
       the centering options will produce 4 equally spaced points as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>
          1: 0,   1/3, 2/3, 1  (include endpoints)
        </li>
        <li>
          2: 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5  (do not include endpoints)
        </li>
        <li>
          3: 0,   1/4, 2/4, 3/4  (do not include right endpoint)
        </li>
        <li>
          4: 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 1  (do not include left endpoint)
        </li>
        <li>
          5: 1/8, 3/8, 5/8, 7/8 (half spacing at the ends)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
