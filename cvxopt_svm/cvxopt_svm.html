      <b>cvxopt_svm</b>,
      a Python program which
      solves a support vector machine (SVM) problem by formulating it
      as a quadratic programming problem to be solved by cvxopt().
    </p>

    <p>
      We are given m data pairs (x_i,y_i), with each y_i being a "grade"
      of -1 or +1.  We also assume that the data is linearly separable,
      that is, that at least one straight line can be which splits the
      data into positive and negative graded items.
    </p>

    <p>
      An SVM can be thought of as a function f(x)=x'*w+b such that
      f(x_i) is negative when y_i is -1 and positive when y_i is +1.
      Moreover, the formula is "optimal" in the sense that the
      line f(x)=0 optimally separates the two sets of data with
      the widest possible margin, and for which the closest positive
      and negative graded data items have f(x) equal to +1 or -1,
      respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      The SVM problem can be described as solving:
      <pre>
        minimize    w'w
        subject to yi ( x'wi+b) >= 1 for 1 <= i <= m
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The cvxopt package includes a quadratic programming option to find x:
      <pre>
       minimize   1/2 x' P x + q' x
       subject to G x <= h
                  A x = b
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      This program demonstrates how to read our problem data and arrange 
      them in a format that allows us to call the cvxopt solver solvers.qp().
