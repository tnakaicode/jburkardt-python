BELLMAN_FORD_TEST
  Python version: 3.6.9
  BELLMAN_FORD implements the Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm.

  Number of vertices = 6
  Number of edges = 10
  The reference vertex is 0

  The edge array:

  Row:       0        1  
  Col
    0:       1        0  
    1:       4        1  
    2:       1        2  
    3:       2        4  
    4:       4        0  
    5:       2        5  
    6:       5        0  
    7:       3        2  
    8:       5        3  
    9:       3        0  

  The edge weights:

     0:            -3
     1:             6
     2:            -4
     3:            -1
     4:             4
     5:            -2
     6:             2
     7:             8
     8:            -3
     9:             3

  The shortest distances:

     0:             0
     1:            -6
     2:            -2
     3:             3
     4:             0
     5:             0

  The vertex predecessor parents for the shortest paths:

     0      -1
