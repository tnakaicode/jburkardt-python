#*****************************************************************************80
#
## I4_GCDB finds the greatest common divisor of the form K^N of two numbers.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    Note that if J is negative, I4_GCDB will also be negative.
#    This is because it is likely that the caller is forming
#    the fraction I/J, and so any minus sign should be
#    factored out of J.
#
#    If I and J are both zero, I4_GCDB is returned as 1.
#
#    If I is zero and J is not, I4_GCDB is returned as J,
#    and vice versa.
#
#    If I and J are nonzero, and have no common divisor of the
#    form K**N, I4_GCDB is returned as 1.
#
#    Otherwise, I4_GCDB is returned as the largest common divisor
#    of the form K**N shared by I and J.
