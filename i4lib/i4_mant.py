#
## I4_MANT computes the "mantissa" of an R8.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    This routine computes the "mantissa" or "fraction part" of a real
#    number X, which it stores as a pair of integers, (J/K).
#
#    It also computes the sign, and the integer part of the logarithm
#    (base 2) of X.
#
#    On return:
#
#      X = S * (J/K) * 2^L
#
#    where
#
#      S is +1 or -1,
#      K is a power of 2,
#      1 <= (J/K) < 2,
#      L is an integer.

#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, real X, the number to be decomposed.
#
#    Output, integer S, the "sign" of the number.
#    S will be -1 if X is less than 0, and +1 if X is greater
#    than or equal to zero.
#
#    Output, integer J, the top part of the mantissa fraction.
#
#    Output, integer K, the bottom part of the mantissa
#    fraction.  K is a power of 2.
#
#    Output, integer L, the integer part of the logarithm (base 2) of X.

#  3: Force X to lie between 1 and 2, and compute the logarithm L.
