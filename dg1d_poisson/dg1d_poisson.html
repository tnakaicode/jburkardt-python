      DG1D_POISSON <br> Discontinuous Galerkin Solution of 1D Poisson Equation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>DG1D_POISSON</b>,
      a Python library which 
      uses the Discontinuous Galerkin Method (DG) to approximate a 
      solution of the 1D Poisson Equation.  
      The code is based on a MATLAB code written by Beatrice Riviere,
      and later translated to Python by Alex Lindsay.
    </p>

    <p>
      A 1D version of the Poisson equation has the form
      <pre>
        - ( K(x) u'(x) )' = f(x)  for 0 < x < 1
 
        u(0) = 1
        u(1) = 0
      </pre>
      Here, we will assume that K(x) = 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      DG1D_POISSON computes an approximate discrete solution to the problem,
      using a version of the Discontinuous Galerkin method.  The interval
      [0,1] is divided into equal subintervals, over each of which a set
      of basis monomials are defined, centered at the midpoint of
      the subinterval, and normalized to have unit value at the subinterval
      endpoints.
    </p>

    <p>
      The discontinous Galerkin equations are then set up as the linear
      system A*c=b, where c represents the coefficients of the basis functions.
      The result of solving this system can then be used to tabulate, evaluate,
      or plot the approximate DG solution function.
