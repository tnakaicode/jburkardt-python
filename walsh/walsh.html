    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>WALSH</b>,
      a Python library which
      implements versions of the Walsh and Haar transforms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the programs, as printed in the reference, had a few 
      typographical errors.  Several programs, in particular FHT and FRT, could 
      not be made to perform as described in the text, and hence have been 
      omitted.
