      CG <br> Conjugate Gradient Solver for Linear Systems
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CG</b>,
      a Python library which
      implements a simple version of the conjugate gradient (CG) method
      for solving a system of linear equations of the form A*x=b, 
      suitable for situations in which the matrix A is positive definite
      (only real, positive eigenvalues) and symmetric.
