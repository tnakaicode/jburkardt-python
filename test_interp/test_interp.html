      TEST_INTERP <br> Interpolation Test Data
    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>TEST_INTERP</b>,
      a Python library which
      defines data that may be used to test interpolation algorithms.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following sets of data are available:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <a href = "p01_plot.png">p01_plot.png</a>, 
          18 data points, 2 dimensions.
          This example is due to Hans-Joerg Wenz.
          It is an example of good data, which is dense enough in areas
          where the expected curvature of the interpolant is large.
          Good results can be expected with almost any reasonable
          interpolation method.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "p02_plot.png">p02_plot.png</a>,
          18 data points, 2 dimensions.  
          This example is due to ETY Lee of Boeing.
          Data near the corners is more dense than in regions of small curvature.
          A local interpolation method will produce a more plausible
          interpolant than a nonlocal interpolation method, such as
          cubic splines.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "p03_plot.png">p03_plot.png</a>,
          11 data points, 2 dimensions.  
          This example is due to Fred Fritsch and Ralph Carlson.
          This data can cause problems for interpolation methods.
          There are sudden changes in direction, and at the same time,
          sparsely-placed data.  This can cause an interpolant to overshoot
          the data in a way that seems implausible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "p04_plot.png">p04_plot.png</a>,
          8 data points, 2 dimensions.  
          This example is due to Larry Irvine, Samuel Marin and Philip Smith.

        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "p05_plot.png">p05_plot.png</a>,
          9 data points, 2 dimensions.

        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "p06_plot.png">p06_plot.png</a>,
          49 data points, 2 dimensions.  
          The data is due to deBoor and Rice.
          The data represents a temperature dependent property of titanium.
          The data has been used extensively as an example in spline
          approximation with variably-spaced knots.
          DeBoor considers two sets of knots:
          (595,675,755,835,915,995,1075)
          and
          (595,725,850,910,975,1040,1075).
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "p07_plot.png">p07_plot.png</a>,
          4 data points, 2 dimensions.  
          The data is a simple symmetric set of 4 points,
          for which it is interesting to develop the Shepard interpolants
          for varying values of the exponent p.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "p08_plot.png">p08_plot.png</a>,
          12 data points, 2 dimensions.  
          This is equally spaced data for y = x^2,
          except for one extra point whose x value is close to another, but whose 
          y value is not so close.  A small disagreement in nearby data can 
          become a disaster.
