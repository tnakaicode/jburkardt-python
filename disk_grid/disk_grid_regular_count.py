#% DISK_GRID_REGULAR_COUNT counts the grid points inside a disk.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    The grid is defined by specifying the radius and center of the disk,
#    and the number of subintervals N into which the horizontal radius
#    should be divided.  Thus, a value of N = 2 will result in 5 points
#    along that horizontal line.
