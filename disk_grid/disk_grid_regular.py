#
## DISK_GRID_REGULAR computes grid points inside a disk.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    The grid is defined by specifying the radius and center of the disk,
#    and the number of subintervals N into which the horizontal radius
#    should be divided.  Thus, a value of N = 2 will result in 5 points
#    along that horizontal line.

#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer N, the number of subintervals.
#
#    Input, real R, the radius of the disk.
#
#    Input, real C(2), the coordinates of the center of the disk.
#
#    Input, integer NG, the number of grid points, as determined by
#    DISK_GRID_COUNT.
#
#    Output, real CG(2,NG), the grid points inside the disk.
