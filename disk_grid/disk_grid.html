      DISK_GRID <br> Grid Points Within a Disk
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>DISK_GRID</b>,
      a Python library which
      generates a grid of points 
      over the interior of a disk in 2D.
    </p>

    <p>
      The library allows the user to define an arbitrary disk by
      choosing its radius and center.  The user also chooses N, the number
      of subintervals into which the horizontal radius line will be subdivided.
      It then returns the gridpoints defined by that choice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another function allows the user to specify that N points on a Fibonacci
      spiral are to be placed within the disk.
    </p>

    <p>
      The test program creates input files to GNUPLOT which will create
      graphic images of the grids.
