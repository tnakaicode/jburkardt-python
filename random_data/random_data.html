      RANDOM_DATA <br> Generation of random data
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>RANDOM_DATA</b>, 
      a Python library which 
      uses a random number generator (RNG) to sample points for
      various probability distributions, spatial dimensions, and geometries,
      including the M-dimensional cube, ellipsoid, simplex and sphere. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of these routines assume that there is an available source
      of pseudorandom numbers, distributed uniformly in the unit
      interval [0,1].  In this package, that role is played by the
      routine R8_UNIFORM_01, which allows us some portability.  
      We can get the same results in a variety of languages.
      In general, however, it would be more efficient to use the
      language-specific random number generator for this purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we have a source of pseudorandom values in [0,1], it's trivial 
      to generate pseudorandom points in any line segment; it's easy to 
      take pairs of pseudorandom values to sample a square, or triples to 
      sample a cube.  It's easy to see how to deal with square region that
      is translated from the origin, or scaled by different amounts in
      either axis, or given a rigid rotation.  The same simple transformations
      can be applied to higher dimensional cubes, without giving us any
      concern.
    </p>

    <p>
      For all these simple shapes, which are just generalizations of 
      a square, we can easily see how to generate sample points that
      we can guarantee will lie inside the region; in most cases, we
      can also guarantee that these points will tend to be <i>uniformly
      distributed</i>, that is, every subregion can expect to contain 
      a number of points proportional to its share of the total area. 
    </p>

    <p>
      However, we will <b>not</b> achieve uniform distribution in the
      simple case of a rectangle of nonequal sides <b>[0,A]</b> x <b>[0,B]</b>,
      if we naively scale the random values <b>(u1,u2)</b> to 
      <b>(A*u1,B*u2)</b>.  In that case, the expected point density of
      a wide, short region will differ from that of a narrow tall region.
      The absence of uniformity is most obvious if the points are plotted.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you realize that uniformity is desirable, and easily lost,
      it is possible to adjust the approach so that rectangles are
      properly handled.
    </p>

    <p>
      But rectangles are much too simple.  We are interested in circles,
      triangles, and other shapes.  Once the geometry of the region 
      becomes more "interesting", there are two common ways to continue.  
    </p>

    <p>
      In the <i>acceptance-rejection method</i>, 
      uniform points are generated in a superregion that encloses the 
      region.  Then, points that do not lie within the region are rejected. 
      More points are generated until enough have been accepted to satisfy the 
      needs.  If a circle was the region of interest, for instance, we
      could surround it with a box, generate points in the box, and throw
      away those points that don't actually lie in the circle.  The resulting
      set of samples will be a uniform sampling of the circle.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the <i>direct mapping</i> method, a formula or mapping
      is determined so that each time a set of values is taken from
      the pseudorandom number generator, it is guaranteed to correspond
      to a point in the region.  For the circle problem, we can use
      one uniform random number to choose an angle between 0 and 2 PI,
      the other to choose a radius.  (The radius must be chosen in
      an appropriate way to guarantee uniformity, however.)  Thus,
      every time we input two uniform random values, we get a pair
      (R,T) that corresponds to a point in the circle.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      The acceptance-rejection method can be simple to program, and 
      can handle arbitrary regions.  The direct mapping method is 
      less sensitive to variations in the aspect ratio of a region 
      and other irregularities.  However, direct mappings are only 
      known for certain common mathematical shapes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Points may also be generated according to a nonuniform density.
      This creates an additional complication in programming.  However,
      there are some cases in which it is possible to use direct mapping
      to turn a stream of scalar uniform random values into a set of
      multivariate data that is governed by a normal distribution.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another way to generate points replaces the uniform pseudorandom number
      generator by a <i>quasirandom number generator</i>.  The main difference
      is that successive elements of a quasirandom sequence may be highly
      correlated (bad for certain Monte Carlo applications) but will tend
      to cover the region in a much more regular way than pseudorandom
      numbers.  Any process that uses uniform random numbers to carry out
      sampling can easily be modified to do the same sampling with
      a quasirandom sequence like the Halton sequence, for instance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The library includes a routine that can write the resulting 
      data points to a file.
