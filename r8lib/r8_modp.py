def r8_modp ( x, y ):

#*****************************************************************************80
#
## R8_MODP returns the nonnegative remainder of real division.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    If
#      REM = R8_MODP ( X, Y )
#      RMULT = ( X - REM ) / Y
#    then
#      X = Y * RMULT + REM
#    where REM is always nonnegative.
#
#    The MOD function computes a result with the same sign as the
#    quantity being divided.  Thus, suppose you had an angle A,
#    and you wanted to ensure that it was between 0 and 360.
#    Then mod(A,360.0) would do, if A was positive, but if A
#    was negative, your result would be between -360 and 0.
#
#    On the other hand, R8_MODP(A,360.0) is between 0 and 360, always.
#
#  Example:
#
#        I         J     MOD R8_MODP  R8_MODP Factorization
#
#      107        50       7       7    107 =  2 *  50 + 7
#      107       -50       7       7    107 = -2 * -50 + 7
#     -107        50      -7      43   -107 = -3 *  50 + 43
#     -107       -50      -7      43   -107 =  3 * -50 + 43
