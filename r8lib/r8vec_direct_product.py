#
## R8VEC_DIRECT_PRODUCT creates a direct product of R8VEC's.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    To explain what is going on here, suppose we had to construct
#    a multidimensional quadrature rule as the product of K rules
#    for 1D quadrature.
#
#    The product rule will be represented as a list of points and weights.
#
#    The J-th item in the product rule will be associated with
#      item J1 of 1D rule 1,
#      item J2 of 1D rule 2, 
#      ..., 
#      item JK of 1D rule K.
#
#    In particular, 
#      X(J) = ( X(1,J1), X(2,J2), ..., X(K,JK))
#    and
#      W(J) = W(1,J1) * W(2,J2) * ... * W(K,JK)
#
#    So we can construct the quadrature rule if we can properly
#    distribute the information in the 1D quadrature rules.
#
#    This routine carries out that task.
#
#    Another way to do this would be to compute, one by one, the
#    set of all possible indices (J1,J2,...,JK), and then index
#    the appropriate information.  An advantage of the method shown
#    here is that you can process the K-th set of information and
#    then discard it.
#
#  Example:
#
#    Rule 1: 
#      Order = 4
#      X(1:4) = ( 1, 2, 3, 4 )
#
#    Rule 2:
#      Order = 3
#      X(1:3) = ( 10, 20, 30 )
#
#    Rule 3:
#      Order = 2
#      X(1:2) = ( 100, 200 )
#
#    Product Rule:
#      Order = 24
#      X(1:24) = 
#        ( 1, 10, 100 )
#        ( 2, 10, 100 )
#        ( 3, 10, 100 )
#        ( 4, 10, 100 )
#        ( 1, 20, 100 )
#        ( 2, 20, 100 )
#        ( 3, 20, 100 )
#        ( 4, 20, 100 )
#        ( 1, 30, 100 )
#        ( 2, 30, 100 )
#        ( 3, 30, 100 )
#        ( 4, 30, 100 )
#        ( 1, 10, 200 )
#        ( 2, 10, 200 )
#        ( 3, 10, 200 )
#        ( 4, 10, 200 )
#        ( 1, 20, 200 )
#        ( 2, 20, 200 )
#        ( 3, 20, 200 )
#        ( 4, 20, 200 )
#        ( 1, 30, 200 )
#        ( 2, 30, 200 )
