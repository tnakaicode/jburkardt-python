def r8_walsh_1d ( x, digit ):

#*****************************************************************************80
#
## R8_WALSH_1D evaluates the Walsh function.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    Consider the binary representation of X, and number the digits
#    in descending order, from leading to lowest, with the units digit
#    being numbered 0.
#
#    The Walsh function W(J)(X) is equal to the J-th binary digit of X.

#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, real X, the argument of the Walsh function.
#
#    Input, integer DIGIT, the index of the Walsh function.
#
#    Output, real VALUE, the value of the Walsh function.
#

#
#  Hide the effect of the sign of X.
#
  x = abs ( x )
#
#  If DIGIT is positive, divide by 2 DIGIT times.
#  If DIGIT is negative, multiply by 2 (-DIGIT) times.
#
  x = x / 2.0 ** digit
#
#  Make it an integer.
#  Because it's positive, and we're using INT, we don't change the
#  units digit.
#
  n = int ( x )
#
#  Is the units digit odd or even?
#
  if ( ( n % 2 ) == 0 ):
