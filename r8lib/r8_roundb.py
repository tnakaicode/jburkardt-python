def r8_roundb ( ibase, nplace, x ):

#*****************************************************************************80
#
## R8_ROUNDB rounds a number to a given number of digits in a given base.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    The code does not seem to do a good job of rounding when
#    the base is negative!
#
#    Assume that the input quantity X has the form
#
#      X = S * J * IBASE^L
#
#    where S is plus or minus 1, L is an integer, and J is a
#    mantissa base IBASE which is either exactly zero, or greater
#    than or equal to (1/IBASE) and less than 1.0.
#
#    Then on return, XROUND will satisfy
#
#      XROUND = S * K * IBASE^L
#
#    where S and L are unchanged, and K is a mantissa base IBASE
#    which agrees with J in the first NPLACE digits and is zero
#    thereafter.
#
#    Note that because of rounding, for most bases, most numbers
#    with a fractional quantities cannot be stored exactly in the
#    computer, and hence will have trailing "bogus" digits.
#
#    If NPLACE is 0, XROUND will always be zero.
#
#    If NPLACE is 1, the mantissa of XROUND will be 0,
#    1/IBASE, 2/IBASE, ..., (IBASE-1)/IBASE.
#
#    If NPLACE is 2, the mantissa of XROUND will be 0,
#    IBASE/IBASE^2, (IBASE+1)/IBASE^2, ...,
#    IBASE^2-2/IBASE^2, IBASE^2-1/IBASE^2.

#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer IBASE, the base of the arithmetic.
#    IBASE must not be zero.  Theoretically, IBASE may be negative.
#
#    Input, integer NPLACE, the number of digits base IBASE to
#    preserve.  NPLACE should be 0 or positive.
#
#    Input, real X, the number to be decomposed.
#
#    Output, real XROUND, the rounded value of X.
