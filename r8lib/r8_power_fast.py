#
## R8_POWER_FAST computes the P-th power of R.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    Obviously, R^P can be computed using P-1 multiplications.
#
#    However, R^P can also be computed using at most 2*LOG2(P) multiplications.
#    To do the calculation this way, let N = LOG2(P).
#    Compute A, A^2, A^4, ..., A^N by N-1 successive squarings.
#    Start the value of R^P at A, and each time that there is a 1 in
#    the binary expansion of P, multiply by the current result of the squarings.
#
#    This algorithm is not optimal.  For small exponents, and for special
#    cases, the result can be computed even more quickly.
