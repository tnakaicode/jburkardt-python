def r8_diff ( x, y, n ):

#*****************************************************************************80
#
## R8_DIFF computes (X-Y) to a specified accuracy.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    The user controls how many binary digits of accuracy
#    are to be used.
#
#    N determines the accuracy of the value of the result.  If N = 10,
#    for example, only 11 binary places will be used in the arithmetic.
#    In general, only N+1 binary places will be used.
#
#    N may be zero.  However, a negative value of N should
#    not be used, since this will cause both X and Y to look like 0.

#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, real X, Y, the two values whose difference is desired.

#    Input, integer N, the number of binary digits to use.
#
#    Output, real VALUE, the value of X-Y.

#  Compute the magnitude of X and Y, and take the larger of the
#  two.  At least one of the two values is not zero!

  size = max ( abs ( x ), abs ( y ) )
#
#  Make normalized copies of X and Y.  One of the two values will
#  actually be equal to 1.
#
  x = x / size
  y = y / size
#
#  Here's where rounding comes in.  We know that the larger of the
#  the two values equals 1.  We multiply both values by 2^N,
#  where N+1 is the number of binary digits of accuracy we want
#  to use, truncate the values, and divide back by 2^N.
#
  x = ( int ( x * pow2 + 0.5 * r8_sign ( x ) ) ) / pow2
  y = ( int ( y * pow2 + 0.5 * r8_sign ( y ) ) ) / pow2
#
#  Take the difference now.
#
  value = x - y
#
#  Undo the scaling.
