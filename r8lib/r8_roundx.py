def r8_roundx ( nplace, x ):

#*****************************************************************************80
#
## R8_ROUNDX rounds an R8.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    Assume that the input quantity X has the form
#
#      X = S * J * 10^L
#
#    where S is plus or minus 1, L is an integer, and J is a decimal
#    mantissa which is either exactly zero, or greater than or equal
#    to 0.1 and less than 1.0.
#
#    Then on return, XROUND will satisfy
#
#      XROUND = S * K * 10^L
#
#    where S and L are unchanged, and K is a decimal mantissa which
#    agrees with J in the first NPLACE decimal digits and is zero
#    thereafter.
#
#    Note that because of rounding, most decimal fraction quantities
#    cannot be stored exactly in the computer, and hence will have
#    trailing "bogus" digits.
#
#    If NPLACE is 0, XROUND will always be zero.
#
#    If NPLACE is 1, the mantissa of XROUND will be 0, 0.1,
#    0.2, ..., or 0.9.
#
#    If NPLACE is 2, the mantissa of XROUND will be 0, 0.01, 0.02,
#    0.03, ..., 0.98, 0.99.

#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer NPLACE, the number of decimal digits to
#    preserve.  NPLACE should be 0 or positive.
#
#    Input, real X, the number to be decomposed.
#
#    Output, real XROUND, the rounded value of X.
#
  xround = 0.0
#
#  1: Handle the special case of 0.
#
  if ( x == 0.0 ):

#
#  2: Determine the sign S.

  if ( 0.0 < x ):

    xtemp = x

#  3: Force XTEMP to lie between 1 and 10, and compute the
#  logarithm L.

#
#  4: Now strip out the digits of the mantissa as XMANT, and
#  decrease L.
