def r8_mant ( x ):

#*****************************************************************************80
#
## R8_MANT computes the "mantissa" or "fraction part" of X.
#
#  Formula:
#
#    X = S * R * 2^L
#
#    S is +1 or -1,
#    R is a real value between 1.0 and 2.0,
#    L is an integer.

#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, real X, the number to be decomposed.
#
#    Output, integer S, the "sign" of the number.
#    S will be -1 if X is less than 0, and +1 if X is greater
#    than or equal to zero.
#
#    Output, real R, the mantissa of X.  R will be greater
#    than or equal to 1, and strictly less than 2.  The one
#    exception occurs if X is zero, in which case R will also
#    be zero.
#
#    Output, integer L, the integer part of the logarithm (base 2) of X.
#

#
#  Determine the sign.
#
  if ( x < 0.0 ):
    s = -1
  else:
    s = 1
#
#  Set R to the absolute value of X, and L to zero.
#  Then force R to lie between 1 and 2.
#
  if ( x < 0.0 ):
    r = -x
  else:
    r = x

  l = 0
#
#  Time to bail out if X is zero.
