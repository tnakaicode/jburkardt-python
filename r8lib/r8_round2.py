def r8_round2 ( nplace, x ):

#*****************************************************************************80
#
## R8_ROUND2 rounds a number to a specified number of binary digits.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    Assume that the input quantity X has the form
#
#      X = S * J * 2^L
#
#    where S is plus or minus 1, L is an integer, and J is a binary
#    mantissa which is either exactly zero, or greater than or equal
#    to 0.5 and less than 1.0.
#
#    Then on return, XROUND will satisfy
#
#      XROUND = S * K * 2^L
#
#    where S and L are unchanged, and K is a binary mantissa which
#    agrees with J in the first NPLACE binary digits and is zero
#    thereafter.
#
#    If NPLACE is 0, XROUND will always be zero.
#
#    If NPLACE is 1, the mantissa of XROUND will be 0 or 0.5.
#
#    If NPLACE is 2, the mantissa of XROUND will be 0, 0.25, 0.50,
#    or 0.75.

#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, integer NPLACE, the number of binary digits to
#    preserve.  NPLACE should be 0 or positive.
#
#    Input, real X, the number to be decomposed.
#
#    Output, real XROUND, the rounded value of X.

#  1: Handle the special case of 0.

#  2: Determine the sign S.

  if ( 0.0 < x ):
    s = 1
    xtemp = x
  else:

#  3: Force XTEMP to lie between 1 and 2, and compute the
#  logarithm L.

#  4: Strip out the digits of the mantissa as XMANT, and decrease L.
