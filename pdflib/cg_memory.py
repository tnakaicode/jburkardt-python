#    Input, integer G, for I = -1 or +1, the index of
#    the generator, with 1 <= G <= 32.
#
#    Input/output, integer CG1, CG2.  For I = -1,
#    these are output, for I = +1, these are input, for I = 0,
#    these arguments are ignored.  When used, the arguments are
#    old or new values of the CG parameter for generator G.
