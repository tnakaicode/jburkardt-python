#
## FROBENIUS_NUMBER_ORDER2_VALUES returns values of the order 2 Frobenius number.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    The Frobenius number of order N is the solution of the Frobenius
#    coin sum problem for N coin denominations.
#
#    The Frobenius coin sum problem assumes the existence of
#    N coin denominations, and asks for the largest value that cannot
#    be formed by any combination of coins of these denominations.
#
#    The coin denominations are assumed to be distinct positive integers.
#
#    For general N, this problem is fairly difficult to handle.
#
#    For N = 2, it is known that:
#
#    * if C1 and C2 are not relatively prime, then
#      there are infinitely large values that cannot be formed.
#
#    * otherwise, the largest value that cannot be formed is
#      C1 * C2 - C1 - C2, and that exactly half the values between
#      1 and C1 * C2 - C1 - C2 + 1 cannot be represented.
#
#    As a simple example, if C1 = 2 and C2 = 7, then the largest
#    unrepresentable value is 5, and there are (5+1)/2 = 3
#    unrepresentable values, namely 1, 3, and 5.
#
#    For a general N, and a set of coin denominations C1, C2, ..., CN,
#    the Frobenius number F(N, C(1:N) ) is defined as the largest value
#    B for which the equation
#
#      C1*X1 + C2*X2 + ... + CN*XN = B
#
#    has no nonnegative integer solution X(1:N).
#
#    In Mathematica, the Frobenius number can be determined by
#
#      FrobeniusNumber[ {C1,...,CN} ]

#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input/output, integer N_DATA.  The user sets N_DATA to 0 before the
#    first call.  On each call, the routine increments N_DATA by 1, and
#    returns the corresponding data; when there is no more data, the
#    output value of N_DATA will be 0 again.
#
#    Output, integer C1, C2, the parameters of the function.
#
#    Output, integer F, the value of the function.
