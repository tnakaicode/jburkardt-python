#
## CONFERENCE returns the CONFERENCE matrix.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    A conference matrix is a square matrix A of order N, with a zero
#    diagonal, and only 1's and -1's on the offdiagonal, with the property
#    that:
#
#      A * A' = (N-1) * I.
#
#    The algorithm employed here is only valid when N - 1
#    is an odd prime, or a power of an odd prime.
#
#    Conference matrices have a relationship with Hadamard matrices:
#
#      If mod ( P, 4 ) == 3, A is antisymmetric, and
#        I + A is hadamard;
#      Else A is symmetric, and
#        (   I + A, - I + A )
#        ( - I + A, - I - A) is Hadamard.
#
#  Example:
#
#    N = 8
#
#     0  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
#    -1  0 -1 -1  1 -1  1  1
#    -1  1  0 -1 -1  1 -1  1
#    -1  1  1  0 -1 -1  1 -1
#    -1 -1  1  1  0 -1 -1  1
#    -1  1 -1  1  1  0 -1 -1
#    -1 -1  1 -1  1  1  0 -1
#    -1 -1 -1  1 -1  1  1  0
#
#  Properties:
#
#    If N-1 is prime, then A[2:N,2:N] is a circulant matrix.
#
#    If N-1 = 1 mod 4, then A is symmetric.
#
#    If N-1 = 3 mod 4, then A is antisymmetric.
