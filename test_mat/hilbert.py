#*****************************************************************************80
#
## HILBERT returns the HILBERT matrix.
#
#  Formula:
#
#    A(I,J) = 1 / ( I + J - 1 )
#
#  Example:
#
#    N = 5
#
#    1/1 1/2 1/3 1/4 1/5
#    1/2 1/3 1/4 1/5 1/6
#    1/3 1/4 1/5 1/6 1/7
#    1/4 1/5 1/6 1/7 1/8
#    1/5 1/6 1/7 1/8 1/9
#
#  Rectangular Properties:
#
#    A is a Hankel matrix: constant along anti-diagonals.
#
#  Square Properties:
#
#    A is positive definite.
#
#    A is symmetric: A' = A.
#
#    Because A is symmetric, it is normal.
#
#    Because A is normal, it is diagonalizable.
#
#    A is totally positive.
#
#    A is a Cauchy matrix.
#
#    A is nonsingular.
#
#    A is very ill-conditioned.
#
#    The entries of the inverse of A are all integers.
#
#    The sum of the entries of the inverse of A is N*N.
#
#    The ratio of the absolute values of the maximum and minimum
#    eigenvalues is roughly EXP(3.5*N).
#
#    The determinant of the Hilbert matrix of order 10 is
#    2.16417... * 10^(-53).
#
#    If the (1,1) entry of the 5 by 5 Hilbert matrix is changed
#    from 1 to 24/25, the matrix is exactly singular.  And there
#    is a similar rule for larger Hilbert matrices.

def hilbert_inverse ( n ):

#*****************************************************************************80
#
## HILBERT_INVERSE returns the inverse of the Hilbert matrix.
#
#  Formula:
#
#    A(I,J) =  (-1)^(I+J) * (N+I-1)! * (N+J-1)! /
#           [ (I+J-1) * ((I-1)!*(J-1)!)^2 * (N-I)! * (N-J)! ]
#
#  Example:
#
#    N = 5
#
#       25    -300     1050    -1400     630
#     -300    4800   -18900    26880  -12600
#     1050  -18900    79380  -117600   56700
#    -1400   26880  -117600   179200  -88200
#      630  -12600    56700   -88200   44100
#
#  Properties:
#
#    A is symmetric: A' = A.
#
#    Because A is symmetric, it is normal.
#
#    Because A is normal, it is diagonalizable.
#
#    A is almost impossible to compute accurately by general routines
#    that compute the inverse.
#
#    A is the exact inverse of the Hilbert matrix; however, if the
#    Hilbert matrix is stored on a finite precision computer, and
#    hence rounded, A is actually a poor approximation
#    to the inverse of that rounded matrix.  Even though Gauss elimination
#    has difficulty with the Hilbert matrix, it can compute an approximate
#    inverse matrix whose residual is lower than that of the
#    "exact" inverse.
#
#    All entries of A are integers.
#
#    The sum of the entries of A is N^2.
#
#    The family of matrices is nested as a function of N.
