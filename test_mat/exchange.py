#
## EXCHANGE returns the EXCHANGE matrix.
#
#  Formula:
#
#    if ( I + J = N + 1 )
#      A(I,J) = 1
#    else
#      A(I,J) = 0
#
#  Example:
#
#    M = 4, N = 5
#
#    0 0 0 0 1
#    0 0 0 1 0
#    0 0 1 0 0
#    0 1 0 0 0
#
#    M = 5, N = 5
#
#    0 0 0 0 1
#    0 0 0 1 0
#    0 0 1 0 0
#    0 1 0 0 0
#    1 0 0 0 0
#
#  Rectangular properties:
#
#    A is integral: int ( A ) = A.
#
#    A is a zero/one matrix.
#
#  Square Properties:
#
#    A is nonsingular.
#
#    A is a permutation matrix.
#
#    A has property A.
#
#    A is symmetric: A' = A.
#
#    Because A is symmetric, it is normal.
#
#    Because A is normal, it is diagonalizable.
#
#    A is persymmetric: A(I,J) = A(N+1-J,N+1-I).
#
#    A is a Hankel matrix: constant along anti-diagonals.
#
#    A is involutional: A * A = I.
#
#    A is a square root of the identity matrix.
#
#    A is orthogonal: A' * A = A * A' = I.
#
#    det ( A ) = ( -1 )^(N/2).
#
#    There are N/2 eigenvalues of -1, and (N+1)/2 eigenvalues of 1.
#
#    For each pair of distinct vector indices I1 and I2 that sum to N+1, there
#    is an eigenvector which has a 1 in the I1 and I2 positions and 0 elsewhere,
#    and there is an eigenvector for -1, with a 1 in the I1 position and a -1
#    in the I2 position.  If N is odd, then there is a single eigenvector
#    associated with the index I1 = (N+1)/2, having a 1 in that index and zero
#    elsewhere, associated with the eigenvalue 1.
#
#    The exchange matrix is also called the "counter-identity matrix".
