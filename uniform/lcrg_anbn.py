#
## LCRG_ANBN computes the "N-th power" of a linear congruential generator.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    We are considering a linear congruential random number generator.
#    The LCRG takes as input an integer value called SEED, and returns
#    an updated value of SEED,
#
#      SEED(out) = ( a * SEED(in) + b ) mod c.
#
#    and an associated pseudorandom real value
#
#      U = SEED(out) / c.
#
#    In most cases, a user is content to call the LCRG repeatedly, with
#    the updating of SEED being taken care of automatically.
#
#    The purpose of this routine is to determine the values of AN and BN
#    that describe the LCRG that is equivalent to N applications of the
#    original LCRG.
#
#    One use for such a facility would be to do random number computations
#    in parallel.  If each of N processors is to compute many random values,
#    you can guarantee that they work with distinct random values
#    by starting with a single value of SEED, using the original LCRG to generate
#    the first N-1 "iterates" of SEED, so that you now have N "seed" values,
#    and from now on, applying the N-th power of the LCRG to the seeds.
#
#    If the K-th processor starts from the K-th seed, it will essentially
#    be computing every N-th entry of the original random number sequence,
#    offset by K.  Thus the individual processors will be using a random
#    number stream as good as the original one, and without repeating, and
#    without having to communicate.
#
#    To evaluate the N-th value of SEED directly, we start by ignoring
#    the modular arithmetic, and working out the sequence of calculations
#    as follows:
#
#      SEED(0)   =     SEED.
#      SEED(1)   = a * SEED      + b
#      SEED(2)   = a * SEED(1)   + b = a^2 * SEED           + a * b + b
#      SEED(3)   = a * SEED(2)   + b = a^3 * SEED + a^2 * b + a * b + b
#      ...
#      SEED(N-1) = a * SEED(N-2) + b
#
#      SEED(N) = a * SEED(N-1) + b = a^N * SEED
#                                    + ( a^(n-1) + a^(n-2) + ... + a + 1 ) * b
#
#    or, using the geometric series,
#
#      SEED(N) = a^N * SEED + ( a^N - 1) / ( a - 1 ) * b
#              = AN * SEED + BN
#
#    Thus, from any SEED, we can determine the result of N applications of the
#    original LCRG directly if we can solve
#
#      ( a - 1 ) * BN = ( a^N - 1 ) * b in modular arithmetic,
#
#    and evaluate:
#
#      AN = a^N
