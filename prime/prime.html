      prime <br> Program to Count Primes
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>prime</b>,
      a Python program which
      counts the number of primes between 1 and N,
      and is intended as a starting point for a parallel version.
    </p>

    <p>
      The algorithm is completely naive.  For each integer I, it simply checks
      whether any smaller J evenly divides it.  The total amount of work
      for a given N is thus roughly proportional to 1/2*N^2.
