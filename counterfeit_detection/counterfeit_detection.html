    <p>
      <b>counterfeit_detection</b>,
      a Python library which 
      considers problems in which one or more counterfeit coins 
      are to be identified by the fact that they do not have the standard weight.
    </p>

    <p>
      Methods include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>brute force:</i> weigh every coin and report those with bad weight;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>combinatorial:</i> assume there is only 1 bad coin, and that the number of coins is 2^n-1.
          carry out n weighings to determine the bad coin.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>compressed sensing:</i> weigh a certain number of random subsets of the coins
          and solve an underdetermined linear system minimizing the l1 norm.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
