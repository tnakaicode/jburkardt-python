      WALKER_SAMPLE <br> Efficient Probability Vector Sampling
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>WALKER_SAMPLE</b>,
      a Python library which
      efficiently samples a discrete probability vector.
    </p>

    <p>
      For outcomes labeled i = 1, 2, 3, ..., N, a discrete probability vector
      X is an array of N non-negative values which sum to 1, such that X[i]
      is the probability of outcome i.
    </p>

    <p>
      To sample the probability vector is to produce a sequence of outcomes
      i1, i2, i3, ..., which are each drawn with probability corresponding 
      to X.  For a general discrete probability vector X, a single sample
      operation might be expected to take a time that is proportional to O(N),
      the number of outcomes.  Walker showed that, by constructing a new
      data structure, it was possible to carry out a sample in time of order 
      O(1), that is, independent of the number of possible outcomes.
