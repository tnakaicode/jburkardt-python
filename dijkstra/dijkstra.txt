DIJKSTRA_DISTANCE_TEST:
  Python version: 2.7.5
  DIJKSTRA_DISTANCE uses Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the minimum
  distance from node 0 to each node in a graph,
  given the distances between each pair of nodes.

  Distance matrix:

    0    40    15   Inf   Inf   Inf 
   40     0    20    10    25     6 
   15    20     0   100   Inf   Inf 
  Inf    10   100     0   Inf   Inf 
  Inf    25   Inf   Inf     0     8 
  Inf     6   Inf   Inf     8     0 

  Distance to node 0:
       0       35       15       45       49       41
