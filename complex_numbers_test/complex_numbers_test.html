    <p>
      <b>complex_numbers_test</b>,
      a Python program which
      demonstrates some of the features of using complex numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first issue is how to declare a complex variable, including
      the choice of precision, whether the variable is a scalar, vector, 
      or array, and whether the variable is initialized with a value, 
      or assigned one.
    </p>

    <p>
      A second issue concerns the question of how a complex variable is
      to be printed out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another issue concerns how a complex variable is to operated on
      by the arithmetic operators of addition, subtraction, multiplication,
      division, and exponentiation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The language also provides a number of intrinsic functions that
      can be applied to a complex variable.  The names of these functions
      can sometimes be easy to forget.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Another issue concerns the details of double precision calculation.
      Even a single accidental use of a single precision function name
      in a double precision computation can result in the loss of half
      the digits of accuracy.  
    </p>

    <p>
      An unusual feature of the implementation of complex numbers in
      Python is that a complex number can be defined by a statement like
      <blockquote>
        z = 1 + 2j;
      </blockquote>
      where the string "2j" is interpreted as "2 times the imaginary unit".
      But this does NOT mean that j by itself means the imaginary unit.
      No, the imaginary unit is represented by "1j".  So you cannot set the 
      imaginary unit by
      <blockquote>
        a = j;
      </blockquote>
      Instead, you would have to write
      <blockquote>
        a = 1j;
      </blockquote>
