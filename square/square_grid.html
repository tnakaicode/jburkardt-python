      SQUARE_GRID <br> Grid of Points Inside a Square in 2D
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SQUARE_GRID</b>,
      a Python library which
      generates a grid of points
      over the interior of a square in 2D.
    </p>

    <p>
      The 2D "square" is actually the quadrilateral bounded by four
      vertices specified by the user in counter clockwise order.  The user 
      specifies the number of grid points to be used in the "X" and "Y"
      directions, and these values may be different.
